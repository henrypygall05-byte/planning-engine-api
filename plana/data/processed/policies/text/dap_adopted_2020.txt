Development and Allocations Plan


=== PAGE 3 ===

Newcastle is a city that is growing. More people are coming to live here, and 
businesses are investing, creating jobs for the future.
But as a growing city, Newcastle City Council needs to carefully manage 
development in an inclusive and sustainable way.
Our Local Plan sets out the local planning framework and has been prepared in 
two parts. The first is the Core Strategy and Urban Core Plan which was adopted 
in 2015. The second is the Development and Allocations Plan (DAP). This sets out 
more detailed policies than the Core Strategy and Urban Core Plan which will 
guide planning decisions, and where development can take place for new homes, 
jobs and a range of uses right up to 2030. 
For the city to grow effectively, it is essential that we balance the needs of all 
our residents against the backdrop of a growing population, the fact that we are 
all living longer, and that families have specific needs such as access to services, 
leisure opportunities and open spaces for health and exercise. We must plan for 
housing, transport and access to employment sites, so people can enjoy a good 
quality of life. This plan is about providing the right development in the right 
place at the right time.
We are committed to ensuring Newcastle is a great place to live. We want our 
policies to be clear, so the city is welcoming to developers, to create jobs for local 
people, and to send a strong message that we are open for business.

Introduction
1.1  Executive Summary
1.1.1  The Development and Allocations Plan (DAP) forms an important part of 
Newcastle’s Local Plan which is a collection of documents that sets the 
framework for development in Newcastle to 2030.
1.1.2  The DAP forms Part 2 of the Local Plan, setting out Newcastle City 
Council’s planning policies for managing development in Newcastle, 
together with site allocations and designations. It will support the 
strategic policies and growth strategy of the Core Strategy and Urban 
Core Plan (CSUCP) which is Part 1 of the Local Plan adopted in March 
2015.
1.1.3  The CSUCP provides strategic planning policies, whilst non-strategic, 
detailed policies are included in the DAP . Together, both plans will 
deliver our growth ambitions. 
 This Plan is structured as follows:
 Section 1 Introduction
 Section 2 Newcastle upon Tyne Local Plan
 Section 3 Economic Prosperity
 Section 4 Homes
 Section 5 Transport and Accessibility
 Section 6 People and Place
 Section 7 Minerals and Waste
 Section 8 Infrastructure and Delivery
 
 Section 9 Appendices

2.1  National Planning Policy and National 
Guidance
2.1.1 Local planning authorities must have regard to the National Planning  
Policy Framework (NPPF) when preparing their Local Plan. The NPPF 
sets out the government’s planning policies for England and how these 
are expected to be applied. The NPPF is supported by more detailed 
Planning Practice Guidance (PPG). The NPPF includes a ‘presumption 
in favour of sustainable development’ . To achieve sustainable 
development, economic, social and environmental gains should be 
sought through the planning system. Local planning authorities should 
positively seek opportunities to meet the development needs of their 
area and plans should meet objectively assessed needs. This DAP has 
been prepared based on this premise, and as such its policies take a 
positive approach in guiding development.
2.2  Newcastle’s Local Plan
 Newcastle’s Local Plan comprises a series of different documents as set 
out in Figure 1.

Part 1 - Planning for the Future - Core Strategy and Urban Core Plan 2010-2030 
(CSUCP)
2.2.1  The CSUCP is a planning framework that provides the strategic vision 
and growth strategy for the future of Newcastle and Gateshead to 2030. 
It forms the first part of both Newcastle’s and Gateshead’s Local Plan 
and sets out both councils’ agenda for delivering healthy sustainable 
communities, achieving economic prosperity and tackling climate 
change. It outlines the ambitions for growth, including the overall 
quantum for housing, employment and retail. The CSUCP includes 
strategic policies, Urban Core policies, sub-areas and site specific 
policies.
Part 2 - Development and Allocations Plan 2015-2030 (DAP)
2.2.2  The DAP is the second part of Newcastle upon Tyne’s Local Plan. It 
provides the details needed to support the strategic policies and growth 
strategy set out in the CSUCP . The DAP includes site allocations and 
designations and sets out the council’s detailed policies for managing 
development, which will be used to assess planning applications. 
Together, both plans will provide strategic and detailed planning policies 
which will ensure that the council has policies in place to deliver our 
ambitions for growth for future generations.
2.2.3  Gateshead Council have prepared a separate part of their local 
plan, Making Spaces for Growing Places. For further information on 
Gateshead’s Local Plan please refer to their website at:
 www.gateshead.gov.uk
Development Management Policies
2.2.4 Development management policies in the DAP will provide detailed, 
often criteria- based policies, supplementing and supporting the strategic 
policies in the CSUCP . The policies and their supporting text are set out 
on a topic basis. Each topic area begins with an introduction setting out 
the purpose of the policy and where relevant, how it supplements the 
CSUCP . The policy text is shown in a box. The explanatory supporting 
text explains the policy, providing more information on how the policy 
will be applied. Other relevant policy links include reference to CSUCP 
Policies, relevant Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs), Guidance 
and the Development Management Validation Checklist.
Site Allocations
2.2.5 The allocations are intended to promote sustainable development and 
assist in delivering the priorities and objectives of national planning 
policy and national planning guidance and the growth of the city as 
outlined in the CSUCP . Allocations will set out a preferred use for a 
specific site. There may also be further detail to support the policy 
allocation to guide the development of sites.

Newcastle upon Tyne Local Plan


=== PAGE 12 ===

2.2.6 Many sites in Newcastle have development potential, but this plan 
cannot identify and allocate every site, and the plan needs to ensure that 
the policy framework provides flexibility for changing circumstances. 
Major sites considered for allocation and inclusion in the document 
will generally be above 0.25 hectares. Other sites may be important 
locally, but the document needs to focus on those most likely to make 
a significant contribution to the objectives of the CSUCP and DAP . 
However, because a site is not included in the DAP it does not imply that 
they are unimportant. The future availability and development of sites 
will be expected to meet the objectives and priorities of both the CSUCP 
and this DAP providing sustainable growth.
2.2.7 The CSUCP includes detailed policies for the Urban Core, including 
Key Sites allocations and a Development Opportunity Site allocation. 
This DAP does not therefore include site allocations for the Urban 
Core. However, development within the Urban Core will still need 
to comply with relevant development management policies set 
out in this DAP . Figure 2, the Newcastle Character Areas shows the 
boundary of Newcastle upon Tyne and the location of the Urban Core, 
Neighbourhood, Rural and Village Areas.

Designations
2.2.8 The designations include both previously defined areas either nationally 
or locally and new designations identified in this DAP . Designations can 
change over time, so site specific requirements listed in the plan only 
reflect the designation at the time of plan preparation.
2.2.9  The Policies Map accompanying this DAP includes a number of statutory 
designations which are set outside the scope of this DAP . These include 
Conservation Areas, Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Local 
Wildlife Sites and a Registered Battlefield. Although the designation of 
these are set, there are a number of development management policies 
in this DAP which relate specifically to development in these areas or 
affecting these designations. It is therefore appropriate to indicate their 
location on the Policies Map.
2.3  Local Plan Supporting Documents
Policies Map
2.3.1 The accompanying Policies Map identifies the location of land use 
allocations, such as sites allocated for housing or employment use, and 
shows designated areas, such as district and local centres and local 
wildlife sites. The Development and Allocations Policies Map should be 
read in conjunction with the CSUCP Policies Map.
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) and Planning Guidance
2.3.2 SPDs and Planning Guidance provide additional detailed guidance on 
how the council’s planning strategy and policies will be implemented for 
specific topics, areas or sites. Further detail of where the council intends 
to develop SPDs and Planning Guidance is included in the text of the 
relevant topic area.
2.3.3 There are a number of approved masterplans for allocated development 
sites in the Urban Core, Neighbourhood and Rural and Village Areas 
in the Core Strategy and Urban Core Plan. These masterplans will 
be material planning considerations and given due weight when 
considering proposals against the Development and Allocations Plan 
policies.
Community Infrastructure Levy
2.3.4 The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) is a charge that local authorities 
can choose to levy on new developments. The money raised will help 
to pay for the infrastructure needed across the city as a result of growth, 
such as schools, strategic green space, flood schemes, and strategic 
transport improvements. The Newcastle upon Tyne CIL was adopted 
by the council in November 2016, and the charges are implemented 
across Newcastle’s charging area. For further information please see our 
website.

Newcastle upon Tyne Local Plan


=== PAGE 14 ===

Statement of Community Involvement
2.3.5 The Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) sets out the process of 
community involvement and engagement that the council will follow 
for each type of Local Plan document and development management 
decision, enabling the community to know how and when they will 
be involved in the planning process. The DAP has been prepared in 
accordance with the SCI 2018.
Neighbourhood Planning
2.3.6 Neighbourhood Planning was introduced through the Localism Act in 
2011. Neighbourhood plans are community-led plans to guide future 
development, regeneration and conservation of an area. They enable 
communities to set local (non-strategic) policies for their local area 
which are in general conformity with the Local Plan. In Newcastle three 
neighbourhood area boundaries have been agreed: Dinnington Parish 
Council, Woolsington Parish Council and Kingston Park Neighbourhood 
Forum. All three are currently developing proposals for their area.
Duty to Cooperate
2.3.7 Plans have to be prepared in accordance with the legal duty to 
cooperate. The duty to co-operate requires local authorities and other 
public bodies to engage constructively, actively and on an ongoing 
basis to maximise the effectiveness of plan making on strategic cross-
boundary matters. The council has engaged with its neighbouring local 
authorities and other relevant organisations in the preparation of the 
DAP to meet its duty to co-operate and will continue to work with them 
on the implementation of this Plan.
Sustainability Appraisal
2.3.8 A Sustainability Appraisal (SA) incorporating a Strategic Environmental 
Assessment (SEA) has been undertaken at various stages of plan 
preparation, to ensure that the policies accord with the principles 
of sustainable development and consider the social economic and 
environmental impacts. The SA objectives for the Local Plan have been 
previously agreed in Part 1 (the CSUCP) and set the parameters for 
subsequent plans to ensure consistency.
2.3.9 The sites and policies identified in the DAP have been appraised 
against the SA’s sustainability objectives, with recommendations made 
during the process as to how sustainability can be improved. The 
outcomes of the SA process have assisted in determining which sites 
and policies provide the most sustainable development opportunities. 
Where appropriate the policies have been amended to improve their 
performance against sustainability.

Evidence Base
2.3.10 This DAP has been informed by various national and locally prepared 
plans, strategies, and evidence produced by the Government, the council 
and partners. It has also drawn upon the evidence base which informed 
the development of the CSUCP . Evidence reports have also been 
specifically prepared for the DAP which form background evidence to 
the policy formation process.
2.3.11 The evidence base reports can be found on the DAP page of the council’s 
website.
Infrastructure and Delivery
2.3.12 The council has prepared an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) for the 
DAP . The CSUCP IDP has also been updated to take account of progress 
on infrastructure schemes.
Monitoring and Implementation
2.3.13 A monitoring framework for the policies and proposals, across the plan 
period, is essential for a coordinated, phased and deliverable plan. The 
CSUCP has an extensive monitoring framework to assess the delivery 
of policies. The DAP will be monitored considering both indicators 
established to monitor the CSUCP , and new indicators prepared for the 
DAP . The monitoring framework for the DAP is set out in Appendix 9.
2.3.14 It is important to ensure that there is a reasonable prospect that 
this Plan’s policies can be implemented over the plan period. 
Implementation of the Local Plan requires partnership working and 
cooperation with a range of organisations, including developers, 
businesses, residents, community and amenity groups, and transport and 
service providers.
2.3.15 The council produces an Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) (previously 
known as an Annual Monitoring Report) containing information on the 
implementation of the Local Plan and the extent to which its planning 
policies are being achieved.
Preparing the Plan
2.3.16 The preparation of the Local Plan has involved consultation with the 
local community and stakeholders, in accordance with national planning 
policy, national planning guidance and the council’s Statement of 
Community Involvement. 
Relationship with Other Strategies
2.3.17 In addition to the evidence base used in the preparation and 
development of the DAP , other council wide strategies and documents 
have also been taken into consideration.

3.1  Employment Sites
3.1.1 The government is committed to securing economic growth in order to 
promote the city as a strong regional, economic focus providing jobs and 
prosperity. It is therefore essential that the council is proactive in enhancing 
and safeguarding the supply of employment sites within the city to support 
sustainable economic growth, meeting the flexible needs of businesses to 
grow.
3.1.2 The council is committed to maintaining and promoting Newcastle’s role 
as the regional employment centre. To achieve this a supply of suitable, 
flexible and diverse business accommodation is required to be available 
throughout the plan period. The CSUCP sets out policies to maintain a 
sufficient supply of employment land and office floorspace to meet the 
development needs of business and support the local economy up to 
2030.
3.1.3 CSUCP Policies CS1, CS3 and CS4 set out the council’s spatial strategy 
for the Urban Core, Neighbourhood and Rural and Village Areas. The 
Urban Core is prioritised as the location for major office development. 
Economic development outside of the Urban Core will be focused on 
the Key Employment Areas of Walker Riverside for marine and offshore 
engineering, and Newcastle International Airport for airport related and 
general employment growth. CSUCP Policy CS5 outlines employment 
and economic growth priorities by promoting a range of high quality 
economic development locations which are attractive and available 
to the market. To meet these priorities, Policy CS6 sets out the need 
to manage the supply of employment land by ensuring a minimum 
requirement for 80 hectares (net) of employment land for Class B1 
(Business, other than those that fall within A2), B2 (General Industrial) 
and B8 (Storage or Distribution) uses are retained together with 410,000 
square metres of office floor space across the city.
3.1.4 Policy DM1 allocates sites across the city to meet the objectives set out 
in the CSUCP to deliver and maintain a range of economic development 
sites. Both new employment sites and existing employment sites are 
allocated under Policy DM1 for economic development uses within Use 
Classes B1, B2 and B8. This will maintain a range of size and type of 
employment sites required through the plan period.

3.1.5 The new employment allocation sites, as well as those in the CSUCP , 
will ensure that Newcastle will have enough employment land to 
accommodate the demand for new sites over the plan period. These 
sites will help ensure that Newcastle’s economy can grow, maximising 
opportunities for local communities to prosper. The allocation of these 
sites represents a positive and proactive approach to encouraging 
sustainable economic growth in locations which are well located 
in relation to available supporting infrastructure, as well as being 
sustainably located for access by workers.

3.1.6 A number of existing employment sites are allocated; these are 
considered to make an important contribution to the city’s economy 
and were previously allocated in the Unitary Development Plan (UDP), 
Benwell Scotswood Area Action Plan (BSAAP) and Walker Riverside Area 
Action Plan (WRAAP).
3.1.7 Development on new employment sites will be limited to employment 
uses in order to meet the developable employment land requirements 
identified in CSUCP Policy CS6. The Employment Land Review (ELR) 
provides a comprehensive assessment of the employment sites. 
The sites proposed for allocation are those which make a significant 
contribution to the city’s employment land portfolio. The council will 
continue working with neighbouring authorities as part of the Local 
Enterprise Partnership (LEP) to bring forward development on the 
allocated sites.
3.1.8 Plans showing the site boundaries of the allocated employment sites are 
contained in evidence. All employment land allocations will be subject 
to protection under Policy DM2.
3.2 Protection of Employment Sites
3.2.1 National planning policy emphasises the importance of supporting 
economic growth and sets out the need to protect sites allocated for 
employment. In addition to identifying new sites, the protection of 
existing sites is vital to ensure a sufficient supply, range and choice of 
employment land is maintained.
3.2.2 Protection of existing employment sites is required to retain the 
most sustainable and valued employment sites, which provide job 
opportunities close to where people live. Existing employment sites are 
a valuable source of employment land and buildings and an important 
location for small businesses and industries. In order to maintain 
a reasonable balance between employment and other uses, well 
performing existing employment locations must be protected.
3.2.3 Policy DM2 seeks to prevent the loss of allocated employment sites from 
B1, B2 and B8 uses. It provides the criteria against which a change of use 
to an alternative use would be assessed.


=== PAGE 25 ===

Economic Prosperity
25
Policy DM2 - Protection of Employment Sites
Sites allocated for employment uses in Policy DM1 and the Core Strategy 
and Urban Core Plan will be restricted to employment uses within Classes 
B1 (Business), B2 (General Industrial) and B8 (Storage or Distribution). Uses 
outside of Use Classes B1, B2 and B8 on allocated employment sites will not be 
permitted unless all of the following criteria are met:
1. It can be demonstrated that there is no current or likely future demand 
for employment uses on the site within Use Classes B1, B2 or B8. To 
demonstrate this, it must be shown that:
 
i. the site has not been occupied for a period of at least 2 years prior  
 to the submission of a planning application;
 ii. any non-employment use proposed cannot be accommodated on  
 alternative sites within the economic market area; and
 iii. there is documented evidence of sustained and active marketing 
for employment use, at local market rental levels, over a 
continuous period for a minimum of 2 years, and there was 
no interest expressed for employment uses. Evidence should 
be provided by marketing and an independent assessment, in 
accordance with the Employment Marketing Guidance set out in 
Appendix 8.
2. The proposed use would not prejudice current or future development  
 of the surrounding employment area or detract from the role of the  
 wider employment area.
3. The development would not undermine the future supply of   
 employment sites across the city.
3.2.4 Existing and new allocated employment sites in the DAP will be 
protected by Policy DM2. The Housing and Economic Land Availability 
Assessment (HELAA), which determines the suitability, availability and 
achievability of land for employment uses, has informed this policy. It 
is essential that allocated employment sites are managed appropriately 
to ensure that the city has enough land to meet its employment needs 
over the plan period, and to ensure that employment sites which 
contribute to industrial, warehousing, and office uses are not lost to 
inappropriate uses. The HELAA and the Employment Land Review (ELR) 
will be reviewed throughout the plan period to inform the assessment of 
applications relating to employment land.
Policy DM2

=== PAGE 26 ===

3.2.5 For applications that would lead to the loss of allocated employment 
sites, the impact of the proposed development on the overall supply 
of employment sites across the city should be considered. For existing 
employment sites this will include: the impact on the surrounding 
employment area and uses, how well the employment area is performing 
in terms of its function, vacancy rates, the condition and age of the units, 
and clear and robust marketing evidence. Proposals for non-employment 
uses will be required to address these points and demonstrate that there 
is no reasonable prospect of the site coming forward for its protected 
use.
3.2.6 Some of the allocated employment sites contain existing uses that do 
not fall within Use Classes B1, B2 or B8. Policy DM2 does not apply to 
these specific units.

3.3 District and Local Centres
3.3.1 National planning policy recognises centres as the heart of their 
communities and encourages Local Plans to pursue policies which 
support their viability and vitality. Newcastle’s retail hierarchy is 
established in CSUCP Policy CS7. The retail hierarchy includes a range of 
centres which are suitable for retail, leisure, commercial, office, cultural, 
community and residential use, appropriate to the relative position of 
each centre in the retail hierarchy and its role and function.
3.3.2 The retail hierarchy designates Newcastle’s Retail Centre, which is 
the regional retail centre and is the priority for strategic retail growth, 
followed by District Centres and then Local Centres (see Appendix 1). 
The CSUCP includes Policies CS7, NC1 and UC2 which provide detailed 
policies for new retail development within Newcastle’s Retail Hierarchy.
3.3.3 Policy DM3 designates District and Local Centres within Newcastle. 
Each centre performs a role and function which reflects the particular 
needs and character of their local community. District Centres are a 
focus for a wider range of convenience goods and services which serve 
a wide catchment area. They usually contain at least one supermarket 
/ superstore, offer a range of non-retail services (for example, shops, 
banks, cafes, restaurants and public houses), have good public transport 
links, strong walk-in catchments and some contain local / community 
facilities, such as a library. Local centres contain a smaller range of shops 
and services which support the daily needs of a smaller catchment area.


=== PAGE 27 ===

Economic Prosperity
27
Policy DM3 - District and Local Centres
Existing and emerging District and Local centres are designated on the Policies 
Map.
1. Within existing centres, development of non-retail uses (outside Use 
Class A1 - shops) at ground floor will only be acceptable where they 
would:
 
i. maintain and enhance the vitality and viability of the centre.
 ii. not dominate or fragment the centre either individually or   
 cumulatively.
 iii. maintain an active ground floor frontage.
2. Within emerging centres, development will be expected to be retail  
 led and act as a focal point for shops, services and facilities to support  
 the surrounding population. This will be achieved by:
 i. protecting the vitality and viability of the emerging centre by  
 delivering a range and balance of retail and supporting uses which  
 are appropriate in scale.
 ii. ensuring that development provides active ground floor frontage,  
 where appropriate.
3.3.4 This policy seeks to protect the role of centres within the retail hierarchy, 
while providing flexibility for other uses where they would support 
the centre’s role and function. Other uses outside Use Class A1 must 
contribute to a centres vitality and viability, including increased levels 
of footfall comparable to surrounding retail uses and provide an active 
frontage. This policy does not preclude changes of use which fall within 
the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) 
(England) Order 2015.
3.3.5 Retail health checks have been prepared for existing District and Local 
centres within the retail hierarchy. These will be used to inform decisions 
on planning applications. The boundaries of each centre in the retail 
hierarchy have been reviewed as part of the retail health checks. This 
review includes an analysis of occupiers, evidence on retail needs and 
development opportunities.
Policy DM3
Policy DM3


=== PAGE 28 ===

Economic Prosperity
28
3.3.6 Great Park District Centre, Armstrong Road and Newbiggin Hall Local 
Centres are emerging centres and are identified on the Policies 
Map. They will be comprehensively developed as part of approved 
masterplans and regeneration schemes. This policy seeks to protect 
the role of these emerging centres within the retail hierarchy whilst 
providing flexibility to ensure a range of uses that will serve the 
needs of the surrounding existing and proposed community. It is 
expected that the range of uses will be retail led but will include local 
services. Residential development may be appropriate where it can be 
demonstrated that it enhances the vitality of the centre. 
3.3.7 Where evidence is readily available, the retail health checks include an 
analysis of the vitality and viability of centres. The retail health checks 
for the District and Local Centres show that the role and function of 
local shopping services is changing. There are now many service uses in 
District Centres and this trend is also reflected in Local Centres. Although 
retailing remains strong, service uses (for example, banks, estate and 
letting agents, cafes and restaurants) also support the role and function 
of District and Local Centres, attracting custom, providing a more diverse 
offer and encouraging linked trips.
3.3.8 The increase in service use provision across the retail hierarchy is also 
reflected nationally, linked to trends including an increase in disposable 
income and leisure time, and also influenced by the popularity of out-of-
centre retail parks and the growth in internet shopping. In this context, 
the role of other supporting uses can in some cases be significant in 
helping to support the vitality and viability of centres. However, it is also 
important to recognise the shopping role of centres, and to ensure that 
the vitality and viability of centres are not adversely affected by non-
retail uses. For this reason, development proposals both individually and 
cumulatively will be assessed to ensure that they do not dominate or 
fragment the centre to the detriment of its retail function.
3.3.9 The council has adopted an SPD relating to hot food takeaways. This 
document focuses on three areas: healthy eating, residential amenity, 
and the vitality and viability of retail centres. Applications that contain 
hot food takeaway uses will be assessed against Policy DM3 and this 
SPD.
3.3.10 In order to maintain a lively and attractive street scene that promotes the 
vitality of a centre, it is important that the main ground floor frontage of 
commercial units have active frontages. An active frontage can consist of 
glazed door openings and shop windows that either show activity within 
the premises or a window display relating to the use of the unit.

3.4 Retail and Leisure Impact Assessment
3.4.1 National planning policy requires an impact assessment to be 
undertaken for retail and leisure proposals which are not in accordance 
with an up-to-date Local Plan. The CSUCP requires retail proposals 
outside of defined centres to prepare an impact assessment in 
accordance with national planning guidance and to consider impacts 
where there could be a significant adverse impact (regardless of 
development size) on a designated centre. Consideration of impacts 
below the national planning threshold of 2,500 square metres may be 
required where development could undermine the vitality and viability 
of a centre, or existing, committed and planned public and private 
investment in a centre or centres.
3.4.2 The CSUCP states that a local threshold for impact assessments will 
be established in future Local Plans to reflect the scale and nature 
of centres in Newcastle. National planning guidance provides advice 
on setting a locally appropriate threshold and advises on the policy 
considerations which should be taken into account when determining 
impacts. This approach has been taken forward in Policy DM4.
Policy DM4 - Retail and Leisure Impact Assessment
An Impact Assessment proportionate to the scale and nature of a proposal will be 
required for:
1. Retail proposals (Class A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) of 500 square metres (net) 
floorspace or more outside of designated centres in the retail hierarchy.
2. Leisure proposals (Class D2) of 500 square metres (net) or more outside 
of the Urban Core, District and Local Centres.
Retail and leisure development must not have an unacceptable adverse impact 
on the vitality and viability of designated centres.
3.4.3 Newcastle has a significant proportion of out of centre retail floorspace, 
and a number of designated centres which are ‘at risk’ (centres which 
are underperforming but have the potential to improve). It is therefore 
considered appropriate to set a lower impact assessment threshold to 
protect against the effect of applications under the national planning 
policy requirement of 2,500 square metres.
3.4.4 The CSUCP prioritises and makes provision for retail development 
in designated centres and the retail policies in this plan support this 
approach. Impact assessments are required to demonstrate that the 
vitality and viability of existing centres is maintained through new 
developments coming forward.
Policy  DM4
Policy DM4


=== PAGE 30 ===

Economic Prosperity

3.4.5 Impact assessments for proposals outside of designated centres which 
exceed the threshold set out in this policy should address the following 
considerations in a proportionate and locally appropriate way:
• the impact of the proposal on the vitality and viability of existing 
centres, including local consumer choice and the range and quality 
of the comparison and convenience retail offer;
• the impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned 
public and private investment in a centre or centres within the 
catchment area of the proposal; and
• the impact of the proposal on in-centre trade/turnover and on trade 
in the wider catchment area, taking into consideration current and 
future consumer expenditure capacity up to five years from the time 
the application is made.

4.1 Housing Sites
4.1.1 As a growing city, Newcastle seeks to create neighbourhoods that offer 
a wide range of affordable and high quality homes to meet people’s 
needs.  Neighbourhoods should have a strong sense of identity, 
attractive well-used spaces and facilities that are accessible and well 
connected, enabling everyone to live enjoyable lives.
4.1.2 The CSUCP sets out the scale, distribution and mix of new homes to be 
delivered in the city by 2030. It identifies the need to plan for 21,000 
new homes in Newcastle. This includes 2,000 purpose-built student 
accommodation units and 19,000 new homes to meet the forecast 
housing needs of the city. The strategy for meeting the housing target for 
the city is identified in CSUCP Policy CS10. In total 7,380 dwellings will 
be delivered through CSUCP Neighbourhood and Village Growth Area 
allocations together with approximately 2,000 homes in Newcastle’s 
Urban Core. In order to provide a range and choice of sites and a realistic 
build profile over the plan period, the DAP allocates sites which could 
deliver approximately 4,200 homes. The policy does not preclude other 
sites from coming forward for housing provided it complies with all 
relevant Local Plan policies.
4.1.3 Sites in the city’s Neighbourhood and Village Growth Areas, together 
with the sustainable expansion of Newcastle Great Park, are allocated 
in the CSUCP . These sites will provide a choice of family housing and 
help to ensure sufficient land is available to meet housing need over 
the plan period. These sites include housing development at Callerton, 
and Kingston Park/Kenton Bankfoot Neighbourhood Growth Areas and 
at Dinnington and Throckley Village Growth Areas. The CSUCP also 
identifies Neighbourhood Opportunity Areas at Benwell and Scotswood 
and Elswick and Walker, as requiring housing investment and an Area 
of Change at Newburn Riverside which is a large-scale brownfield site 
suitable for a new sustainable community.
4.1.4 CSUCP Policy UC4 identifies a range of new development sites in the 
Urban Core which will help to meet the continuing housing demand. 
These will come forward on Key Sites, a Development Opportunity Site, 
in mixed use schemes and on smaller sites. For this reason there are no 
allocations for the Urban Core housing sites identified in this DAP .
4.1.5 The policies contained in this plan will provide greater certainty to 
the housing market, whilst seeking to allow for flexibility to adapt 
to rapid change in Newcastle. Policy DM5 provides clarity on sites 
prioritised to be brought forward for housing development (Use Class 
C3 Dwellinghouses) over the plan period. Other forms of specialist 
residential accommodation could also be accommodated in the 
allocation sites to meet the city’s needs. The sites included in DM5 are 
generally smaller sites than allocated in the CSUCP . The inclusion of 
specialist residential accommodation and smaller sites will contribute 
to providing a mix and choice of homes of price, type and tenure 
throughout the plan period until 2030.

4.1.6 The threshold size for allocation is a site area of over 0.25 hectares or 
with capacity for at least 10 dwellings and above. Small and medium 
sized sites (1 hectares or under) play an important role in meeting the 
housing delivery for the city, whilst providing choice and variety of new 
homes.
4.1.7 The HELAA contains an assessment of future housing and employment 
sites and is regularly updated with details of the trajectory and 5 year 
housing land supply in the city. The DAP has responded positively to 
new opportunities for housing sites that have become available and 
which can make a positive contribution to meeting the housing need of 
the city’s population.
4.1.8 Housing allocations in the DAP include a number of previously 
developed sites that were allocated in the Walker Riverside and Benwell 
Scotswood Area Action Plans and also identified within Neighbourhood 
Opportunity Areas in the CSUCP . The housing allocations in these 
Opportunity Areas will ensure provision of a range of housing to improve 
the quality and choice of housing and to ensure they remain attractive 
and sustainable communities.
4.1.9 The city has experienced increased rates of delivery of new homes 
since the start of the CSUCP plan period in 2010. However, this is in part 
attributable to a council-led programme of interventions in the market 
to deliver market and affordable dwellings. The delivery of new homes 
remains challenging within the Neighbourhood Opportunity Areas 
and within areas of the city experiencing low market demand. Where 
planning applications are submitted that are not policy compliant, it will 
be for the applicant to demonstrate whether particular circumstances 
justify the need for a viability assessment at the application stage.
4.1.10 The duty on local authorities and other bodies to have regard to local 
self-build and custom housebuilding registers requires monitoring 
of demand for this form of development. Sites that are suitable for 
housing would normally also be suitable for self-build and custom 
housebuilding. Within the city a number of self-build plots have recently 
been made available by private housing developers. Where appropriate 
the council will seek to plan for self-build serviced plots and custom 
housebuilding on sites taking into account feasibility and viability. If 
the level of demand increases significantly then development schemes 
will be encouraged to incorporate self-build serviced plots and custom 
housebuilding.

4.1.11 Two sites in the city currently in use as public open space (land to the 
north of Thornley Road (site 40) and land to the south of Hartburn Walk 
(site 41)) have been identified in Policy DM5 as having the potential to 
be developed for specialist and/or affordable housing which will help 
meet the city’s housing need. The development of these sites will result 
in the loss of open space. Such proposals which result in the loss of 
existing open space are not usually permitted unless deemed surplus 
to requirements or the loss resulting from the development is replaced 
by equivalent or better provision in a suitable location. Supporting 
development on these sites will enable the delivery of much needed 
specialist and affordable housing. An open space assessment will be 
required for sites 40 and 41 to assess the impact of the loss of the 
open space in the locality and identify the necessary re-provision to 
compensate for the loss. The amount and type of alternative re-provision 
will be determined when the proposals come forward.
4.2 Accessible and Adaptable Housing
4.2.1 National planning policy outlines that in order to create inclusive and 
mixed communities local planning authorities should plan for a mix 
of housing, based on the needs of different groups in the community. 
In addition, new residential accommodation should be adaptable to 
changes in an individual’s circumstances.
4.2.2 The promotion of lifetime neighbourhoods and providing a choice of 
quality accommodation is a strategic objective in the CSUCP . CSUCP 
Policy CS11 encourages the provision of Lifetime Homes, Wheelchair 
Accessible Homes, and increasing choice of suitable accommodation 
for the elderly population and those with special needs, including 
bungalows, sheltered accommodation and extra care accommodation.
4.2.3 To support independent living, personal wellbeing and ensure that new 
homes are fit to support a range of future needs, Policy DM6 sets out 
accessibility requirements for new homes.
Policy DM6 - Accessible and Adaptable Housing
The design of new build homes will be required to be flexible and adaptable for 
the future to meet the needs of the population. This will be achieved by requiring 
new housing developments of 10 dwellings or more to provide 25% of all new 
homes to be built to Accessible and Adaptable Standard (Building Regulation 
M4(2)).
Accessible and Adaptable Standard is defined as homes in Use Class C3 
(dwellinghouses) built to be resilient and flexible for the future needs 
of the city. This will include homes built to accessible and adaptable 
standards suitable for future adaptation to meet the forecast needs for 
the elderly and the changing needs of residents. Currently the relevant 
accessible and adaptable standard is M4(2) of the building regulations. 
In future the specific measures incorporated into schemes will need to 
demonstrate compliance with the relevant government standards for 
accessible and adaptable homes at that time.
Policy DM6

4.2.4 National planning guidance gives authorities the option to set additional 
technical requirements, exceeding the minimum access standards 
required by building regulations, to achieve improvements to housing 
stock suitable for the varied needs of the population.
4.2.5 The city’s population, like the majority of the UK, is ageing with the 
number of people aged 65 years and over expected to increase by 
around 14,200 between 2015-2030 accounting for 47%1 of net 
population growth over this period. The resultant changing housing 
requirements of an older population need to be recognised and 
addressed. This can in part be met through increasing the accessible and 
adaptable standards applied to all new housing through Policy DM6.
4.2.6 The specific measures incorporated into schemes will need to 
demonstrate compliance with the relevant accessible and adaptable 
standard (Building Regulation M4(2)). Where step-free access is not 
feasible for site specific reasons or other circumstances are justified, 
such as on steeply sloping land or stair accessed apartments, off-site 
contributions towards meeting the citywide need in new build dwellings 
will be required. Where it can be demonstrated that step free access 
is not viable, the accessible and adaptable (Building Regulation M4(2)) 
requirement would not apply either on or off site.
4.3 Space Standards
4.3.1 The Nationally Described Space Standards includes a set of gross 
internal areas which represents a reasonable level of internal provision 
for new dwellings. The standard varies for different types of dwellings 
and incorporates requirements for internal storage, minimum bedroom 
size and a minimum floor to ceiling height. Overall these features 
are intended to ensure that new homes provide a flexible and high 
quality environment capable of responding to occupants needs and 
supporting a high quality of life. Policy DM7 requires new homes meet 
the Nationally Described Space Standards to accommodate the needs of 
residents and remain attractive to successive generations.
Policy DM7 - Space Standards
The design of all new homes will be required to meet the Nationally Described 
Space Standards.
Policy DM7
Policy DM7


=== PAGE 38 ===

Homes

4.3.2 The Government’s Nationally Described Space Standards will secure 
new homes which can accommodate a basic set of furniture, fittings, 
activity and circulation space. These standards will be introduced in 
one year from the date of adoption allowing for a period of transition in 
accordance with the national planning guidance. It will not be applied 
retrospectively to those applications for reserved matters where the 
outline permission was determined or is subject to a resolution to grant 
permission (including subject to planning obligations) before the end of 
the transition period. The city benefits from significant identified historic 
assets, and demonstrable constraints to policy compliant conversion of 
properties will be taken into account as necessary.
4.4 Specialist Residential Accommodation
4.4.1 The need for specialist accommodation is expected to increase. CSUCP 
Policy CS11 seeks to provide a range and choice of housing to meet 
the varied needs of our population. The building of attractive and 
sustainable development is critical to meeting the objectives of the plan. 
Policy DM8 sets out criteria for the development of specialist residential 
accommodation.
Policy DM8 - Specialist Residential Accommodation
All development providing specialist residential accommodation will be required 
to be:
1. Located within an existing community and to deliver a mix of housing 
within that community.
2. Easily accessible to existing local services and facilities, including local 
health care services.
3. Designed to Accessible and Adaptable Standard (Building Regulation 
M4(2)) and/or Wheelchair User Standard (Building Regulation M4(3)).
Specialist Residential Accommodation is defined as Class C3 
(Dwellinghouses) and C2 (Residential Institutions) which provides 
specially designed homes for people with specific needs, including 
assisted living accommodation for people over 55 years old, retirement 
and sheltered apartments and housing where care is provided. General 
needs bungalows and student accommodation are excluded from this 
definition.
Policy DM8
Policy DM8


=== PAGE 39 ===

Homes4.4.2 Providing specialist accommodation and homes which are attractive 
for people with specific housing requirements will help meet future 
housing and care needs, whilst assisting in releasing under-occupied 
larger family homes. The council’s Specialist Housing Delivery Plan2 aims 
to help people to stay living independently for as long as possible in a 
home of their choice. This could either be via a supply of purpose-built 
housing designed to meet specific needs or needs groups, or providing 
adaptations to existing homes.
4.4.3 Specialist accommodation should be developed in suitable and 
sustainable locations, integrated within the community and within 
easy access to services to promote independent living. Currently 
specialist accommodation will be expected to conform to the 
appropriate standards set out within the Building Regulations (as 
amended 2015) relating to Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings 
Category M4(2) or Wheelchair User Dwellings M4(3) and in the future 
specialist accommodation will be expected to comply with the relevant 
government standards. These requirements are in addition to those set 
out in Policy DM6 relating to Accessible and Adaptable standards.

4.5 Campus for Ageing and Vitality (CAV) Site
4.5.1 The Campus for Ageing and Vitality (CAV) site, formerly known as 
the General Hospital site, is approximately 12 hectares and located 
on Westgate Road within easy access of the Urban Core. A number 
of healthcare services in the city have been transferred away from 
the site and this has led to large parts of the site becoming available 
for redevelopment. Policy DM9 allocates the site for mixed-use 
development.
Policy DM9 - Campus for Ageing and Vitality (CAV) Site
The Campus for Ageing and Vitality (CAV) site, identified on the Policies Map, is 
allocated for mixed-use. The principal uses will include, Retail (A1), Business Uses 
(B1) and Residential Institutions (C2), Dwellinghouses (C3) and Non-residential 
Institutions (D1).
1. Development on the CAV site will be required to:
 i. masterplan the site to demonstrate a comprehensive and co-  
  ordinated approach to the site’s redevelopment;
 ii. provide high quality sustainable design and scale and massing  
 appropriate to the character of the area;
 
Policy DM9

 iii. sustain, conserve and enhance the significance, appearance,  
  character and setting of heritage assets;
 iv. investigate, preserve and promote the significance and   
  understanding of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire - Hadrian’s  
  Wall World Heritage Site;
 v. maintain public access through the site through the provision of  
pedestrian and cycle links between Nuns Moor Road and Westgate 
Road, Wingrove Road and Brighton Grove;
 vi. protect and enhance important trees and landscape features; and
 vii. provide a foul and surface water drainage strategy.
2. Retail use must not exceed 1,300 square metres (net) of convenience 
goods floorspace and must provide an active frontage onto Westgate 
Road.
4.5.2 At present the CAV site is only partially in use. The northern portion 
of the site contains the Newcastle University Campus for Ageing and 
Vitality. Redevelopment of the southern portion and western parts of 
the site for future office and research and development investment 
opportunities could form part of a knowledge driven, cluster for science 
and technology attached to the existing research facilities on the site.
4.5.3 The delivery of both general needs and specialist forms of housing on 
the CAV site will also contribute towards providing a range and choice 
of homes for the local community, as well as promoting the wider 
regeneration of the area and, supporting local shops and services.
4.5.4 The comprehensive and coordinated development of the site in 
accordance with a masterplan will provide the opportunity to ensure the 
site is utilised to its full potential and a wide range of benefits from the 
site redevelopment are secured. The masterplan will need to identify 
how each phase of the development will deliver a sustainable form of 
development. Further guidance is set out in the Campus for Ageing and 
Vitality Site Evidence Paper and Sequential Test.
4.5.5 The site includes opportunities for the creative re-use and interpretation 
of designated and non-designated heritage assets. Hadrian’s Wall passes 
along the southern edge of the site and forms part of the wider Frontiers 
of the Roman Empire – Hadrian’s Wall World Heritage Site. Hadrian’s Wall 
is an asset of Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) and opportunities to 
better reveal the significance of the Wall its setting and the buffer zone 
will be sought.
4.5.6 The site masterplan will need to show access to the site and secure 
pedestrian and cycle routes providing permeability through the site 
linking Nuns Moor Road with Westgate Road and Wingrove Road with 
Brighton Grove.
Policy DM9


=== PAGE 41 ===

Homes4.5.7 The site also contains protected trees. Development will need to protect 
and enhance tree and landscape features on the site in accordance with 
DM28. A coordinated drainage strategy in accordance with CS17 and 
DM26 for the site will also need to be developed. 
4.5.8 A small convenience foodstore is appropriate in the south west area 
of the site to link to the adjacent West Road District Centre. The size 
of the store will be limited to a maximum of 1,300 square metres (net) 
floorspace to ensure that it would not unacceptably harm the vitality 
and viability of other nearby District and Local Centres. The design of 
the foodstore will need to respect the setting of adjacent heritage assets 
providing active ground floor frontage.

5  Transport and Accessibility
Transport and Accessibility
42
National policy promotes sustainable development which minimises trip 
generation and journey length, encourages the use of sustainable modes 
of transport and promotes accessibility for all. Sustainable development 
also helps reduce the need for people to travel, manages congestion, 
improves road safety, meets climate change reduction targets, as well as 
improving people’s health by creating more opportunities for walking 
and cycling.
Transport and accessibility policies will ensure sustainable transport 
choices are integrated into future developments. They will support the 
delivery of the priorities and principles set out in the CSUCP , and at a 
regional level in the “Our Journey, A 20 year Transport Manifesto for the 
North East Combined Authority (NECA)”3.
CSUCP Policy CS13 sets out how the enhancement and delivery of an 
integrated transport network to support sustainable development will 
be promoted in Newcastle. This includes encouraging sustainable travel 
choices, improving the operation of the transport network and measures 
to ensure future development is safe for users and maximises the 
opportunities to use sustainable transport modes.
Transport assessments, transport statements, and travel plans have 
an important role in supporting the delivery of national, regional and 
local transport policies and objectives. They are key mechanisms 
in determining the impact of proposals, and are required as part 
of planning applications where the development is likely to have 
significant transport implications. Further details on submitting transport 
assessments, transport statements and travel plans can be found in 
Transport Assessments, Travel Plans and Parking Developer Guidance.
Road vehicles are a major source of Nitrogen Dioxide and particulate 
matter. As in many urban areas in the UK, it is these air pollutants that 
cause the greatest concern in Newcastle. The preparation of a transport 
assessment or statement and a travel plan can help mitigate Newcastle’s 
air quality issues by ensuring developments are accessible by walking, 
cycling and public transport. Developments that are likely to have an 
adverse effect on air quality as a result of increased traffic levels will 
be required to undertake an air quality assessment in accordance with 
Policy DM24 Environmental and Health Impacts of Development.
5.1 Pedestrian and Cycle Movement
5.1.1 Improving accessibility for walking and cycling has multiple benefits, 
including the creation of safer, more attractive places, improved physical 
and mental health and reduced carbon emissions and climate change 
impacts from transport. Policy DM10 requires development to be 
designed to encourage walking and cycling.


=== PAGE 43 ===

Transport and Accessibility
Policy DM10 - Pedestrian and Cycle Movement
Development will be required to:
1. Provide safe, convenient, attractive and continuous pedestrian and cycle 
links to key local facilities and services.
2. Provide connections through developments both to the existing and 
future wider pedestrian and cycle network.
3. Demonstrate that major developments are within acceptable walking 
and cycling distances of key local facilities and services.
5.1.2 Development must be designed to encourage walking and cycling. 
Consideration should be given to how barriers to walking and cycling, 
such as gaps in the pedestrian and cycle network, gradients, poor 
quality and maintenance of routes and concerns regarding safety can be 
addressed. Routes must be legible, inviting, direct, pleasant, easy to use 
and designed to ensure that accessible and inclusive environments are 
provided for all.
5.1.3 To improve accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists, developments are 
required to provide links through sites and routes to the wider walking 
and cycling network. This includes the Public Rights of Way (PROW) 
Network and the pedestrian and cycle network.  The PROW network 
is also important for equestrians. Developments should facilitate 
equestrian movement by enhancing the existing network through the 
creation of linkages and safe crossings, and by increasing access to the 
PROW network. A pedestrian and cycling network plan will be developed 
based on the Department for Transport’s (DfT) Local Cycling and Walking 
Infrastructure Plans (LCWIP) guidance4 and this will form part of the 
council’s Cycling Strategy.
5.1.4 Enabling people to consider cycling as an alternative transport choice 
has the potential to significantly increase its modal share for every-day 
trips, thereby reducing traffic congestion. For this reason, developing 
the city’s cycle network and links to it is central to Newcastle’s long-
term cycling strategy. Converging at the Urban Core, the cycle network 
connects communities to key facilities and services.
5.1.5 An important factor in encouraging people to walk and cycle is ensuring 
that key local facilities and services, such as shops, schools and public 
transport are easily accessible on foot and by cycle. The distance people 
are prepared to walk or cycle depends on a range of factors, including 
the attractiveness of the route and destination. Major developments 
should refer to national guidance including LTN 1/04 Policy, Planning 
and Design for Walking and Cycling, LTN 2/08 Cycle Infrastructure 
Design and CIHT Planning for Walking and any subsequent revisions or 
relevant new publications, to ensure an acceptable level of accessibility 
is achieved.

5.2 Public Transport
5.2.1 Public transport provides one of the most viable alternatives to the 
private car and can play a significant role in minimising the number of 
car trips on the highway network as well as providing for other benefits 
such as improving health and wellbeing and reducing carbon emissions. 
National guidance promotes managing patterns of growth to promote 
use of public transport. This includes designing developments, where 
practical, to have access to high quality public transport facilities.
5.2.2 Policy DM11 sets out in more detail how developments can promote 
public transport as a sustainable travel choice, as required by CSUCP 
Policy CS13.
Policy DM11 - Public Transport
1. Major development will be required to promote and facilitate the use of 
public transport and demonstrate accessibility by public transport to the 
Urban Core and other key local facilities.
2. Callerton Parkway, Newcastle Great Park, Kingston Park and Regent 
Centre are designated on the Policies Map as park and ride facilities. The 
designated Callerton Parkway site has potential to accommodate up to 
600 park and ride parking spaces.
5.2.3 To ensure major developments are accessible by public transport they 
should be within 400 metres walking distance of a bus stop or 800 
metres of a Metro station. Major developments must be served by 
existing or new bus services at a frequency commensurate with the 
scale, nature and location of the development proposed. The layouts of 
new major developments should be designed to facilitate the efficient 
operation of bus services and routes should be as direct as possible.
5.2.4 Public transport accessibility is expected to be demonstrated through 
a Transport Assessment or Transport Statement and will be assessed 
against the frequency and travel time to the Urban Core and key local 
facilities (including the nearest district centre and local centres, schools 
and General Practitioners).
5.2.5 Minimising car traffic which enters the city and instead utilising public 
transport will assist in reducing congestion on the highway network and 
the associated adverse impacts upon air quality in areas situated close 
to roads. For this reason, the retention and where necessary expansion 
of park and ride facilities on the edge of the city is appropriate to 
accommodate travel demands from existing and future developments. 
It is widely accepted that the provision of Park and Ride facilities can 
contribute to reducing levels of congestion and the number of vehicles 
in town and city centres.

Transport and Accessibility
5.2.6 The Callerton Parkway Park and Ride designation currently contains 
a 195 space car park. It is one of the most successful park and ride 
schemes in Tyne and Wear due to its location next to a Metro Station and 
the A696 on the western edge of the city. Housing developments to the 
west of the city including at Upper, Middle and Lower Callerton are likely 
to increase parking demand at this location. The designation allows for 
up to 600 spaces for park and ride parking within the site. 
5.2.7 Newcastle Great Park Park and Ride is a 500 space car park on the 
northern edge of the city with direct links to the A1. The facility provides 
direct access to a high-frequency bus public transport corridor, linking 
the Great Park with the Regent Centre Interchange, Gosforth and the 
Urban Core. Expanded housing developments at the Great Park and to 
the north of the city will increase parking demand at this location. The 
operation of the Newcastle Great Park Park and Ride is under review 
and it is likely to incorporate pick up and drop off provision for nearby 
schools.
5.2.8 Kingston Park provides 96 car parking spaces. It is next to a District 
Centre and Metro and provides a key link to the Urban Core and 
Newcastle International Airport. Regent Centre Park and Ride provides 
a 183 space multi-storey car park. It is located on a key public transport 
route linking to both the metro system and local bus services, local 
services and the Urban Core.
5.3 Parking and Servicing
5.3.1 Policy DM12 includes requirements for development to manage both 
parking and servicing. The availability of parking has a direct impact on 
the mode of travel people choose for their journey. Parking provided 
as part of developments must be of an appropriate quality and level 
to cater for the development and visitors whilst, helping to promote 
sustainable transport choices.
5.3.2 Adequate servicing allows businesses to operate efficiently. However, 
this needs to be balanced with the adverse impact freight movements 
and servicing and loading requirements can have on the environment 
and quality of place.
Policy DM12 - Parking and Servicing
Development will be required to provide:
1. Safe, secure and useable vehicle and cycle parking that satisfies its 
operational requirements and is generally in accordance with the parking 
levels set out in Appendix 6.
2. Employee changing and shower facilities for major non-residential 
developments.
3. Adequate drop-off and collection, servicing and loading facilities.
45
Policy DM12
Policy DM12


=== PAGE 46 ===

5.3.3 It is important that parking provision is safe, secure and located   
 in convenient places. Measures such as providing appropriate lighting  
 and surveillance can help reduce crime and the fear of crime, thereby  
 increasing the usability of parking facilities.
5.3.4 Demand for car parking in urban areas will be managed to reduce 
long-stay commuter parking and improve conditions for sustainable 
transport modes. Appendix 6 sets out guidance on the appropriate 
parking levels for cycles and vehicles. The guidance has taken into 
consideration factors such as car ownership levels and demand arising 
from various types of development. The levels of car parking associated 
with a particular type of development should normally be in accordance 
with Appendices 6a and 6b. Other levels of car parking provision may 
be acceptable depending on the particular circumstances of the site, 
including its accessibility to sustainable means of transport, and whether 
proposals include complementary initiatives that could reduce the need 
to travel by private car. Proposed parking levels should be justified 
and set out through a Transport Statement or Transport Assessment as 
appropriate. Further guidance on parking specifications is set out in the 
council’s Transport Assessments, Travel Plans and Parking Developer 
Guidance.
5.3.5 Funding from the DfT’s Cycle City Ambition Fund has supported 
improvements to help create a cycle-friendly city environment. 
Developments can contribute towards this objective by encouraging 
the increased use of cycling through providing appropriate facilities 
for cyclists. These will include providing levels of safe, secure and 
useable cycle parking, both for residential and commercial development. 
Guidance on the appropriate level of cycle parking is set out in Appendix 
6c. Further guidance on cycle parking specifications is set out in the 
council’s Transport Assessments, Travel Plans and Parking Developer 
Guidance. The provision of appropriate shower and changing facilities 
for employees in major non-residential developments will promote 
cycling.
5.3.6 Development will also be required to demonstrate how any servicing 
and loading requirements associated with its day-to-day operation 
have been incorporated into its design in accordance with the council’s 
Transport Assessments, Travel Plans and Parking Developer Guidance. 
Proposals will be required to demonstrate impacts on highway operation 
and safety, and how the routes and space required for the manoeuvring 
of refuse collection and delivery vehicles will be accommodated. 
CSUCP Policy UC8 requires all major developments within the Urban 
Core Freight Management Area of the city to provide a Delivery Service 
Plan. Further details on submitting a Delivery Service Plan can also be 
found in the Transport Assessments, Travel Plans and Parking Developer 
Guidance.

5.4 Road Hierarchy
5.4.1 Newcastle’s highway network performs a range of functions, from roads 
that are designed primarily to move people and vehicles as efficiently as 
possible, to streets where the emphasis is on creating a sense of place. 
These functions often put competing demands on the highway and 
balancing the needs of all users can be challenging. CSUCP Policy CS13 
requires development to connect safely and minimise its effects on the 
existing transport network. The road hierarchy is part of the council’s 
highway network management strategy to address these challenges.
5.4.2 Directing vehicular traffic onto key road corridors can help mitigate the 
impacts of development. The road hierarchy, as set out in Policy DM13, 
can also discourage through traffic, whilst maintaining local access for 
residents and businesses. This creates opportunities, particularly in 
those areas not included in the hierarchy, to improve conditions for 
pedestrians and cyclists, and create welcoming places that are safe and 
attractive to all.
Policy DM13 - Road Hierarchy
The following hierarchy of roads are designated on the Policies Map in order to 
support the management of movement on the highway network and to ensure 
the safe and efficient movement of people and goods.
1. Strategic Road
2. Primary Distributor Road
3. Secondary Distributor Road
4. Public Transport Distributor Road
Development must ensure that proposals are in accordance with the road 
hierarchy definitions as set out in Appendix 2.
5.4.3 Newcastle’s road hierarchy consists of Strategic Roads (which are 
managed by Highways England), Primary Distributor Roads, Secondary 
Distributor Roads and Public Transport Distributor Roads. Public 
Transport Distributor Roads can be classed as either Primary or 
Secondary Distributor Roads depending on their characteristics.
5.4.4 Development should direct traffic to the appropriate type of road within 
the hierarchy, depending upon the level and form of traffic likely to be 
generated. This will assist in reducing conflict between different road 
users and ensure a safe and suitable access from the development to the 
existing transport network.

5.5 Mitigation and Highway Management
5.5.1 The council acting as local highway authority, has the responsibility to 
provide and maintain a functional, safe highway network. Policy DM14 
will ensure the safe movement of traffic within Newcastle.
Policy DM14 - Mitigation and Highway Management
1. Development will be required to adequately mitigate against its impact 
on the highway network in the interests of safety, efficiency and 
accessibility.
2. Development involving works to the public highway will be required 
to be undertaken in accordance with the standards of the highway 
authority.
3. Development creating new public highway to be adopted by the council 
will be required to be constructed in accordance with the standards of 
the highway authority.
5.5.2 To limit the impacts of development, proposals must ensure that safe 
and suitable access to a site can be achieved onto the existing transport 
network, and that improvements can be undertaken on the network. 
Conflicts between vehicles and other road-user groups should be 
minimised and proposals should ensure highway solutions are safe and 
accessible for all modes.
5.5.3 Development will also be required when necessary to undertake works 
to the existing public highway to mitigate its impacts on the safety of 
the highway network. These works are often undertaken under section 
278 of the Highways Act 1980. These highway works must be designed 
to meet the future needs for the range of transport modes that could be 
affected by the development, in accordance with the standards of the 
highway authority. Where development proposals seek to create new 
lengths of highway infrastructure then this will also be required to be 
built to the standard of the highway authority to ensure it is safe for all 
future users.
5.5.4 Where the developer proposes that highway infrastructure is adopted 
by the highway authority, it will be necessary to enter into an agreement 
with the council. Developers should refer to the relevant approved 
council standards to ensure that highway works are delivered to the 
satisfaction of all parties.

People and Place
6.1 Conservation of Heritage Assets
6.1.1 The rich and varied historic environment within Newcastle is important to its 
physical, social and cultural development. It is a key contributor to the city’s 
unique identity and creates social and economic benefits. Together, the suite 
of policies relating to the conservation of heritage assets, the conservation 
and enhancement of the setting of heritage assets, the preservation of 
archaeological remains, building recording, shopfronts and signage, 
temporary shroud adverts and the Battlefield of Newburn Ford collectively 
comprise a positive strategy for the conservation and protection of the 
city’s historic environment. When combined with the pro-active approach 
established in the CSUCP (Policies CS15 and UC14) - which promotes the use, 
enjoyment and understanding of the historic environment, seeks to reduce 
the level of heritage at risk, supports appropriate adaptive reuse of heritage 
assets and takes opportunities for the contemporary interpretation of the 
city’s historic environment - the council has developed a wide ranging positive 
approach to the historic environment. These policies reflect the importance 
of one of England’s principal historic cities, celebrating, valuing, conserving, 
sustaining and enhancing a historic legacy from roman, medieval, post-
medieval and modern times. 
6.1.2 Policy DM15 sets out how development affecting the heritage assets in 
the city will be managed.
Policy DM15 - Conservation of Heritage Assets
1. The alteration, extension, restoration or development of heritage 
assets must sustain, conserve and, where appropriate, enhance their 
significance, appearance, character and setting. Proposals will be 
required to:
 i. be accompanied by a detailed analysis and justification of   
 potential impact of the development on the heritage asset and its  
 context;
 ii. conserve built fabric and architectural detailing that contributes to  
 the heritage asset’s significance and character; and
 iii. ensure that extensions or alterations to heritage assets are   
 appropriate in scale, mass, footprint, materials and architectural  
 detailing and reflect the significance of the heritage asset.
2. Development must ensure that the significance of a conservation area 
and registered park and garden is preserved or enhanced, including 
retention of historically important features.

3. The demolition of an unlisted building in a conservation area will only be 
allowed if:
 i. the building is of limited merit and makes little or no contribution  
 to the character or appearance of the conservation area; and
 ii. any replacement development or new use would contribute to  
 the conservation or enhancement of the character or appearance  
 of the conservation area; and a contract for the approved   
 replacement development has been let.
6.1.3 Policy DM15 provides a strategy for the conservation and enhancement 
of the historic environment by focusing on the individual heritage assets 
and their significance, appearance, character and setting as a basis for 
informing change. Alterations should be informed by the significance 
of the heritage asset, which may include historic fabric or architectural 
detailing and, should seek to retain such fabric and detailing. Where 
possible, alterations should be reversible. However, the reversibility of 
an alteration does not provide justification for those works which are 
considered to be harmful to the significance of the heritage asset.
6.1.4 In accordance with national planning policy any proposal which results 
in harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset will be 
required to demonstrate that public benefits will outweigh any harm 
caused.
6.1.5 Any proposals which result in harm to the significance of non-designated 
heritage assets will be considered against national guidance. A local 
list of the city’s buildings and sites considered to be of historic or 
architectural value to the local community has been adopted as an SPD. 
The list of non-designated heritage assets includes a range of buildings, 
spaces and structures. The Tyne and Wear Historic Environment Record 
contains detailed information which can help to establish the identity 
and significance of potential non-designated heritage assets.
6.1.6 Newcastle contains 12 conservation areas. They are supported by 
Conservation Area Character Appraisals, Statements and Management 
Plans. These documents will be a material consideration in the 
assessment of proposals for development that affect the character of 
conservation areas and will be used to support and guide enhancement.
6.1.7 The demolition of an unlisted building within a Conservation Area will 
normally require planning permission. Any application for demolition 
will need a clear justification on its contribution to the architectural 
and historic value to the area. Demolition should only take place once a 
contract has been let for the approved replacement development.
6.1.8 A number of heritage assets within the city are identified on the Heritage 
at Risk Register. Development proposals which affect heritage assets 
included on the Heritage at Risk Register will be required to demonstrate 
how they will bring that heritage asset into repair, and where possible, 
reuse. Development proposals which leave heritage assets vulnerable to 
risk will not be supported in accordance with CSUCP Policy CS15(2).

6.2 Conservation and Enhancement of the 
Setting of Heritage Assets
6.2.1 The setting of heritage assets is defined within national planning 
guidance. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its 
surroundings evolve. The setting of heritage assets may make a positive 
or negative contribution to the significance of an asset. CSUCP Policy 
CS15 requires development to respect and enhance the setting of 
heritage assets. Policy DM16 provides further detail as to how the impact 
of developments upon the setting of heritage assets will be assessed.
Policy DM16 - Conservation and Enhancement of the Setting of Heritage Assets
Development proposals which impact on the setting of heritage assets will be
required to:
1. Ensure that its design, location, siting, form and appearance conserves 
or enhances the significance of the heritage asset, its setting and 
surrounding key views.
2. Consider any additional impacts on the setting of heritage assets, 
including the degree of permanence of any impact.
6.2.2 The setting of heritage assets can vary greatly. In most cases it will 
extend beyond the boundary of the heritage assets itself. In considering 
the impact of development upon the setting of heritage assets a range 
of attributes will be taken into consideration including its proximity to 
the asset, degree to which location will physically or visually isolate the 
asset and position in relation to key views, as well as the cumulative 
impact along with other alterations or developments in the area. The 
impact of a development upon the form and appearance of the heritage 
asset will include its prominence, dominance or conspicuousness, the 
use of materials, architectural style and any associated activity arising 
from the development.
6.2.3 In addition to the above impacts upon the setting of heritage assets, 
other wider effects may also need to be assessed, including any 
changes to built surroundings and spaces and skyline arising from the 
development, any noise, environmental and amenity impacts that could 
affect the heritage asset, as well as changes to public access, tree cover 
and archaeological context. Effects on setting can also include the 
permanence of the development and any longer term or consequential 
effects arising from the development.
6.2.4 When assessing the impact of a development upon the setting of a 
heritage asset, the significance of the affected heritage assets, including 
their character and appearance, and the local characteristics of the area 
will need to be taken into consideration. Any public benefits arising from 
the proposal will be considered against any harm to the heritage assets 
in accordance with national guidance.

6.3 Preservation of Archaeological Remains and 
Archaeological Work
6.3.1 For over two thousand years, there have been communities living and 
working on the north bank of the River Tyne. The modern landscape 
contains physical traces of these past communities within and beneath 
it. Newcastle contains physical remains dating from prehistoric to 
modern times. The Hadrian’s Wall corridor, which is protected as a 
UNESCO World Heritage Site, runs through the city. Many of Newcastle’s 
suburbs originated as medieval villages and the city itself was once a 
walled medieval town.
6.3.2 Newcastle has a high concentration of heritage assets of archaeological 
interest. National planning guidance advises that local planning 
authorities should require developers to record and advance 
understanding of any heritage assets to be lost. CSUCP Policy 
CS15 requires development to support and safeguard the historic 
environment by promoting the use, enjoyment and understanding of the 
historic environment. Policy DM17 sets out in more detail how better 
understanding of heritage assets can be achieved through archaeological 
recording and where appropriate their preservation. Preservation of 
archaeological remains is the first choice and must be considered before 
excavating and recording.
Policy DM17 - Preservation of Archaeological Remains and Archaeological Work
1. Development will be required to safeguard the understanding of the 
historic environment of the city through undertaking archaeological 
investigations where proposed development may affect a known site or 
potential area of archaeological remains.
2. Where assessment and evaluation have established that proposed 
development will adversely affect a site or area of archaeological 
interest the developer will be required, where justified, to preserve 
the remains in-situ. Where preservation in-situ is not justified the 
archaeological remains below ground and on the surface will be 
recorded and excavated prior to development commencing.

3. The Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the Frontiers of the Roman 
Empire World Heritage Site will be protected and sustained. To achieve 
this, development will be required to protect, maintain and enhance the 
integrity and understanding of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World 
Heritage site, and its setting.
4. The results of archaeological investigations must be deposited with the 
Tyne and Wear Historic Environment Record and Tyne and Wear Archives. 
Any significant archaeological findings will also be published.
6.3.3 Policy DM17 relates to both designated and non-designated heritage 
assets and requires that, where appropriate, planning applications 
will be accompanied by archaeological investigations: desk-based 
assessment, geophysical survey, fieldwalking, topographical survey and 
evaluation trenching. The findings of the preliminary archaeological work 
may indicate the need for further archaeological mitigation.
6.3.4 The need to undertake archaeological work is determined by the 
local planning authority. Archaeological work must be undertaken by 
a suitably experienced professional archaeological organisation in 
accordance with a specification provided by the council or a Written 
Scheme of Investigation written by the applicant’s archaeologist and 
approved by the council. All archaeological work must be carried out 
in accordance with the relevant Chartered Institute for Archaeologists 
Standard and Guidance.
6.3.5 The need to preserve remains in-situ will be determined by the 
local planning authority considering the nature of the heritage asset. 
Archaeological remains are valuable evidence of the city’s past. Their 
protection is an important consideration when development which 
affects known or potential archaeological sites is proposed.
6.3.6 Opportunities will be sought through development, which support 
and maintain the positive management of the World Heritage Site and 
deliver improved conservation, presentation and interpretation of the 
Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Site. The World Heritage 
Site Management Plan will guide assessment of proposals.
6.3.7 This policy ensures that archaeological investigation takes place prior 
to or during intrusive development in areas of archaeological potential 
or interest. The purpose of pre-determination archaeological work is to 
ascertain whether heritage assets are likely to be affected by a proposed 
development and to determine their significance and degree of survival. 
Where it is agreed that the heritage asset does not require preservation 
in-situ, archaeological mitigation fieldwork ensures that the remains are 
fully recorded before being lost.
6.3.8 The results of the building recording and archaeological recording must 
be deposited with the Tyne and Wear Historic Environment Record 
and Tyne and Wear Archives. Significant findings must also be formally 
published in order to make the information publicly accessible and to 
advance understanding.

6.4 Building Recording
6.4.1 Where a development will comprise works to a designated or non-
designated heritage asset then building recording will be required, as set 
out in Policy DM18.
Policy DM18 - Building Recording
Prior to the demolition, alteration, extension or restoration of heritage assets 
(both designated and non-designated) appropriate building recording relevant to 
the asset’s significance and the scope of works will be undertaken and the results 
deposited with the Tyne and Wear Historic Environment Record and Tyne and 
Wear Archives.
6.4.2 Building recording may comprise detailed archaeological survey or a 
photographic record, depending upon the significance of the heritage 
asset and the nature of the works proposed. The survey must be 
undertaken by a suitably experienced professional in accordance with 
a specification provided by the council and to the relevant Historic 
England and Chartered Institute for Archaeologists Standard and 
Guidance.
6.5 Battlefield of Newburn Ford 1640
6.5.1 The Battle of Newburn Ford took place on 28 August 1640 between 
the English and Scottish Armies as part of the Second Bishops War. The 
defeat of the English resulted in the surrender of Newcastle to the Scots. 
Due to this historic significance, the Battlefield of Newburn Ford is a 
Registered Historic Battlefield designated as a heritage asset. National 
policy describes Registered Historic Battlefields as being ‘assets of the 
highest significance’ . As such the council sets out in Policy DM19 its 
approach to preserving and raising awareness of the significance of the 
Battlefield of Newburn Ford and ensuring substantial harm or loss to the 
heritage asset is wholly exceptional. 
Policy DM19 - Battlefield of Newburn Ford 1640
The significance of the Battlefield of Newburn Ford will be protected, sustained 
and enhanced by:
1. Protecting it against development which adversely affects the 
interpretation of the course of events during the battle.
2. Requiring development to enhance the appearance of the Battlefield 
through careful design of landscaping, use of materials, and provision of 
public access and interpretation.

6.6 Design
6.6.1 Good design is essential to secure sustainable high quality development 
and inclusive places. To achieve this CSUCP Policies CS15 and UC12 
requires development to respond positively to local distinctiveness and 
character, and be safe, accessible, respect significant views and take the 
opportunity to include public art features. Policy DM20 sets out detailed 
place-making criteria to be used alongside national guidance and CSUCP 
Policies CS15 and UC12.
Policy DM20 - Design
Development will be required to deliver high quality and sustainable design by:
1. Taking full advantage of positive site features including retaining the 
best buildings and securing opportunities to improve the character and 
quality of an area.
2. Demonstrating a positive response to topography, natural and built 
landscapes.
3. Using materials, colours, tones and textures appropriate to the 
characteristics of the area.
4. Enhancing the appearance of the city from major movement corridors.
5. Accommodating an appropriate mix of uses.
6. Making efficient use of land by promoting higher densities where 
appropriate, taking account of the character of the area and location.
Policy DM20
55


=== PAGE 56 ===

7. Taking a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach to development. 
8. Incorporating hard and soft landscaping as an integral part of design, 
maximising tree planting, where appropriate, and providing for its long-
term maintenance.
9. Providing high quality inclusive spaces and buildings which promote 
active and healthy lifestyles.
10. Incorporating measures to address the impacts of climate change and    
adverse microclimatic conditions.
11.  Integrating mechanical plant, refuse and cycle storage into the design of 
a building.
12.  Ensuring that development contributes to a reduction in crime and 
disorder and is resilient to terrorism, delivers safe and secure buildings 
and spaces.
6.6.2 High quality design should create attractive places through good 
architecture and effective landscaping contributing towards a well-
designed city. To achieve this, development will be required to set a 
high standard of design which respects its surroundings. Policy DM20 
will ensure that the best buildings, positive site features, landscape 
and historic features are retained where possible. Best buildings are 
considered to be of architectural merit, reflecting a high standard of 
design quality and/or demonstrating design innovation of a particular 
period of time.
6.6.3 Development should ensure it is integrated into its surrounding built, 
natural and historic environments by adding to the overall quality of the 
area. A range of options should be explored demonstrating appropriate 
massing and a mix of uses for the site. Buildings should also be flexible 
so that they can change and adapt over time. In order to achieve 
sustainable development, proposals should make optimal use of land, 
particularly in highly accessible locations subject to an assessment of 
site constraints. The opportunity for high quality hard and soft landscape 
design will be integral to achieve a successful design.
6.6.4 The council’s Landscape Character Assessments6 and the Tyne and Wear 
Historic Landscape Characterisation Report7 will assist in identifying 
the unique character of parts of the city and should be taken into 
consideration when considering opportunities to improve an areas 
character and quality.
People and Place

Policy DM20


=== PAGE 57 ===

People and Place6.6.5 Major movement corridors include key routes into the city by road, cycle, 
rail and river and across a variety of rural and urban settings. These 
are defined in Appendix 3. They are key in promoting the perception 
of Newcastle as an attractive and interesting place. These routes 
merit special attention where high quality design will be particularly 
important. Enhancement along these routes should provide high 
quality architecture and could include tree and hedgerow planting, 
improvement of vistas from bridges, improving building frontages and 
forecourts. 
6.6.6 High quality design should create buildings and spaces that promote 
active and healthy lifestyles, can be successfully accessed and used by 
everyone safely, and ensure that they assess the defence and security 
threats, can be adaptable to other uses and are resilient to the effects 
of climate change. This requires consideration as to how buildings and 
their individual elements are viewed and function together to encourage 
multiple benefits for all. In considering the layout and design of 
buildings, development must demonstrate how it has included measures 
that address its impact upon climate change such as impact upon local 
microclimatic conditions, including daylight and sunlight, shadowing, 
glare, urban heat islands, and wind.
6.6.7 Successful places are both attractive and functional with the servicing 
of buildings and requirements such as refuse and cycle storage and 
mechanical plant integrated into the design.
6.6.8 Design and Access Statements should clearly set out how the design of 
the development addresses the criterion of this policy, other policies 
in the DAP and the CSUCP .  In areas of the city where major strategic 
development is proposed its design principles will need to be set 
out either in a masterplan or design code to deliver coordinated and 
coherent design that reflects the areas unique character.

6.7 Shopfronts and Signage
6.7.1 Shopfronts and signage are integral features of the Urban Core, District 
and Local Centres and on commercial streets across the city. The 
sensitive treatment of surviving historic shopfronts, introduction of 
complementary modern shopfronts and the use of appropriate signage 
is intrinsic to the preservation and enhancement of the environment. 
Well-maintained and appropriately designed shopfronts and signage can 
make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of an area 
and often reflect its vitality and viability. Policy DM21 sets out criteria to 
be used for development proposals affecting shopfronts and signage.
57


=== PAGE 58 ===

Policy DM21 - Shopfronts and Signage
1. Development proposals which include shop frontages will be required 
to:
 i. retain, restore and, where appropriate, reinstate historic shopfront  
 features where they would positively contribute to the character  
 of the area;
 ii. incorporate new shopfronts which respect the design, materials,  
 scale and proportions of their host building, and respect the  
 character of the surrounding area;
 iii. design any external signage to reflect the scale and proportions of  
 the shopfront, its host building and setting.
2. Any security measures affecting shopfronts will be required to 
respect the significance, context and appearance of the building and 
surrounding streetscene.
6.7.2 The preservation, maintenance and reinstatement of historic shopfronts 
and careful use of signage is vital to preserving and enhancing the 
significance of heritage assets. Planning Guidance should be used to 
inform acceptable designs of shopfronts.
6.7.3 Where new shopfronts are introduced appropriate proportions and 
recognisable design cues should be adopted across the façade as part of 
a complementary contemporary design using high quality materials.

6.8 Temporary Shroud Adverts
6.8.1 The display of scaffolding shroud or large ‘wrap’ advertisement banners 
on development sites are often used to cover the face of the building 
during refurbishment works to buildings.
6.8.2 Whilst this form of large scale advertising can be beneficial in the short 
term in masking building works and providing colour and interest, a 
poorly placed shroud advertisement out of scale and character with 
its surroundings can have a negative impact on the appearance of the 
built environment, especially upon heritage assets and on the natural 
environment that surrounds the site. Policy DM22 sets out criteria to be 
followed for temporary shroud adverts.
People and Place
58
Policy DM21
Policy DM21


=== PAGE 59 ===

People and Place
Policy DM22 - Temporary Shroud Adverts
Advertisement consent will only be granted for temporary shroud advertisements 
where:
1. The scale and illumination of the temporary shroud advertisement is 
appropriate to the building and its context.
2. Planning permission and/or listed building consent has been granted for 
the redevelopment or the refurbishment of the site.
3. The shroud advertisement is commensurate to the scale of the 
scaffolding relating to the above works, with a 1:1 image of the proposed 
or existing building also depicted on the shroud.
4. The shroud advertisement is acceptable in public safety terms.
5. The shroud is for a temporary period of not more than 12 months or the 
period of the works, whichever is the shorter.
6.8.3 Shroud adverts will be allowed where there is a clear justification for 
shrouding the façade of the building, normally through the granting of 
planning permission and/or listed building consent on the site and an 
enclosing shroud is required on public safety grounds. The principle of 
placing a shroud advertisement on a building needs to be considered in 
the context of the site and its impacts upon the wider streetscene and 
the setting of nearby heritage assets.
6.8.4 The existing or proposed building should be illustrated as part of the 
background to the shroud design, with the advertisement feature clearly 
framed within the wider display. The proposed shroud and its printed 
images should generally replicate the architectural detailing of the 
building and provide visual interest. A time limit of not more than 12 
months will be placed on the period the advert can be displayed or the 
period of works, whichever is the shorter. This is required in order to 
ensure the advert shroud is only displayed for a minimum amount of 
time necessary to carry out the works.
6.8.5 Public safety, normally in the form of the impact of the advertisement on 
road users, can also be a key factor in assessing shroud advertisements, 
particularly at locations where conditions could pose a traffic hazard. 
Restriction on illumination will also be considered if it is required in the 
interests of amenity or public safety.

6.9 Residential Amenity
6.9.1 A key objective of the CSUCP is to provide opportunity for a high 
quality of life for everyone and to enhance the wellbeing of people and 
to reduce inequalities. To achieve this objective CSUCP Policy CS14 
requires development to prevent any negative impacts upon residential 
amenity. Policy DM23 sets out in further detail the range of issues which 
will be taken into consideration when determining if a proposal would 
impact upon residential amenity. In circumstances where the type or 
degree of change resulting from a proposal would have an adverse 
impact on residential amenity, permission will normally be refused.
Policy DM23 - Residential Amenity
1. Development will be required to provide a high quality environment 
and a good standard of residential amenity for existing and future 
occupants of land and dwellings. Development which would have an 
unacceptable adverse impact on the residential amenity of existing or 
future occupants of land and dwellings will not be allowed.
2. Impact on residential amenity will be assessed to:
 i. protect the distinctive character of the existing building(s) and the  
 surrounding area with respect to the design, scale and materials  
 used on the building(s);
 ii. protect trees and other soft landscaping of amenity value,   
 providing replacement planting where necessary;
 iii. ensure development will maintain a good standard of daylight,  
 sunlight, outlook and privacy for all existing and future occupants  
 of buildings;
 iv. avoid the introduction of unacceptable additional accesses,   
 traffic or parking resulting in an increase of visual intrusion, noise  
 or disturbance; and
 v. ensure that noise, disturbances, smells, fumes and other harmful  
 effects from surrounding land uses and/or associated operations  
 will not have an unacceptable adverse impact on residential  
 amenity.
6.9.2 Residential areas can be adversely affected by development which 
increases building or population density including extensions, 
conversions, redevelopment, and sub-division of curtilages to create 
new building plots. The impact may arise directly from the building 
work, displacing garden space or other greenery, or resulting in a lack 
of reasonable outlook or light from windows. It may also arise indirectly 
from increased activity, traffic, noise, disturbance, or overlooking of 
private areas.
People and Place
60
Policy DM23
Policy DM23


=== PAGE 61 ===

People and Place
6.9.3 Development which could impact upon the daylight, sunlight or 
shadowing must be supported by an appropriate study demonstrating 
that good standards are retained for both existing and future residents. 
Similarly, where residents’ privacy and outlook could be compromised 
by development suitable spacing should be retained between buildings. 
Planning Guidance on recommended separation distances between 
residential buildings will be set out in Design Guidance.
6.9.4 The design of development will be expected to show a regard for 
local character particularly in matters such as height, massing, spacing 
between buildings, building lines, boundary treatment, landscaping and 
external materials. 
6.9.5 Soft landscaping such as trees and hedges are a major factor in the 
quality of residential environment. The potential impact of development 
on trees and other soft landscaping of amenity value is therefore an 
important consideration which may influence the extent, location or 
form of development achievable on a site.
6.9.6 Some dwellings are in predominantly non-residential settings such as 
rural areas, others are in higher density urban areas or in the upper floors 
of shopping or business areas. The operation of the policy will take 
account of residential amenity in the local site context.

6.10 Environmental and Health Impacts of   
 Development
6.10.1 For sites to be suitable for development it is necessary to take into 
account the environmental and health impacts of proposals. CSUCP 
Policy CS14 sets out how the wellbeing and health of communities will 
be protected by preventing negative impacts on residential amenity and 
wider public safety from environmental hazards such as noise, ground 
instability, ground and water contamination, vibration and air quality. 
Policy DM24 provides further detail on the individual and cumulative 
impacts of development on health and seeks to ensure everyone can 
enjoy a high quality of life.
61


=== PAGE 62 ===

Policy DM24 - Environmental and Health Impacts of Development
1. Proposals will be required to demonstrate that there is no unacceptable 
adverse environmental and health impacts (including cumulative 
impacts) from the development. To achieve this development must 
assess and mitigate the following environmental and health impacts:
 i. air quality and the opportunities to improve air quality;
 ii. noise, vibration and overheating arising from the development;
 iii. known or suspected land contamination or instability which would  
 place existing or future occupants and users at risk;
 iv. light pollution levels from artificial light on amenity and   
 biodiversity;
 v. odours which would have an impact on amenity; and
 vi. hazardous installations, ensuring they do not place existing or  
 future occupants and users at risk.
2. Development must assess the impact of existing noise generating 
uses on the proposed development and implement a mitigation 
scheme, where appropriate, on the proposed use. There should be no 
unreasonable restrictions placed on an existing noise generating use 
arising from a development.
6.10.2 Local Authorities are required to carry out regular reviews of pollution 
levels and designate Air Quality Management Areas for areas that are 
at risk of not meeting government standards. Air Quality Action Plans 
have identified a range of measures to help reduce emissions. Particular 
consideration is given to the impacts of traffic generation and travel by 
road on air quality levels.
6.10.3 Developments likely to produce emissions which adversely affect air 
quality, either as a direct result of the operations of a development or 
through increased traffic generated by the development, will be required 
to undertake an air quality assessment in order to quantify its impact 
upon local air quality levels. Where pollution levels are anticipated to 
adversely affect air quality then measures will be required to mitigate 
the impact of development upon local air quality. Mitigation will need to 
incorporate measures set out in the relevant Air Quality Action Plan.
6.10.4 National planning guidance requires planning decisions to ensure 
noise does not give rise to unacceptable adverse impacts on health 
and quality of life. To achieve this, appropriate surveys will be required 
to demonstrate that noise impacts have been mitigated to avoid 
unacceptable adverse impacts on health and quality of life. Where any 
other adverse impacts on health and quality of life have been identified 
arising from noise, either as a direct result of the development or from 
existing site conditions, then this will need to be mitigated, to reduce 
the adverse impact to the lowest observed adverse effect level, in 
accordance with the latest national policy. 
People and Place
62
Policy DM24
Policy DM24


=== PAGE 63 ===

People and Place Additionally, where a site could be affected by vibration either as a result 
of the development or from existing adjacent land uses, then any impact 
upon human health will need to be adequately mitigated. The impacts 
of overheating on health and the environment will also need to be 
assessed and mitigated.
6.10.5 Newcastle has historically been home to heavy industries and mining. 
Consequently, previously developed sites may still contain a legacy of 
ground contamination and ground instability. When sites come forward 
for development, the potential health impacts upon future uses of the 
site and the environment must be investigated, and where necessary 
mitigated. The submission of a Contaminated Land Report and Coal 
Mining Risk Assessment will be required where sites are known to be 
contaminated or are likely to contain contamination from previous uses, 
or fall within the Coal Authority’s identified areas of risk.
6.10.6 Poorly designed external lighting can have an unacceptable impact on 
health and wellbeing and biodiversity. For this reason, where external 
lighting could cause a material increase in illumination levels, that 
could result in light pollution and impact upon local amenity, then an 
assessment in accordance with national guidance, setting out light 
levels and associated effect on its surroundings will be required. If 
development could result in odours, appropriate control measures 
should be introduced to ensure that there is no unacceptable adverse 
impact upon the surrounding area.
6.10.7 Sites where hazardous substances could be present and where 
development is proposed near them will need to be carefully managed. 
Proposals which would involve the containment or emission of 
hazardous substances which could impact upon existing sensitive uses 
or place sensitive uses close to existing sites containing hazardous 
substances will be determined in accordance with advice from the 
Health and Safety Executive.
6.10.8 Development will need to be carefully integrated into its surroundings. 
In the case of areas which contain existing noise generating uses, 
assessment and in some instances, mitigation will be required in order to 
ensure development is acceptable.
6.10.9 The council’s Development Management Validation Checklist sets 
out criteria and thresholds when background reports on various site-
specific matters are required to support an application. The checklist is 
reviewed every two years to ensure that information required is relevant, 
necessary and material to an application and site. The checklist includes

6.11 Aircraft Safety
6.11.1 Newcastle International Airport is the international gateway into the 
Region playing a key role as a major contributor to economic activity and 
regeneration in the North East. The CSUCP allocates land at the Airport 
as a Key Employment Area in Policy KEA1. Policy DM25 seeks to address 
safety issues related to the airport’s location near to an urban area.
Policy DM25 - Aircraft Safety
1. Development that would have an unacceptable impact on the 
operational integrity or safety of Newcastle International Airport in the 
aerodrome safeguarded area will not be permitted unless appropriate 
mitigation is secured.
2. Development resulting in an increase in the number of people residing, 
working or congregating in the public safety zones at each end of the 
airport runway will not normally be permitted.
6.11.2 The aerodrome safeguarding process is set out in the Town and 
Country Planning (Safeguarded Aerodromes) Direction 2002. Its 
purpose is to ensure the airport’s operation and development is not 
inhibited by buildings, structures, erections, or works that would 
infringe protected surfaces, obscure runway approach lights or could 
impair the performance of aerodrome navigation aids, radio aids or 
telecommunication systems. Newcastle International Airport Limited 
is the statutory safeguarding consultee for developments within 
its aerodrome area (broadly a 13km area around the Airport). The 
Aerodrome Safeguarding Area is broken into different zones of risk, 
shown on the council’s interactive mapping. The airport, Ministry of 
Defence (MOD) and National Air Traffic Services (NATS) will be consulted 
on planning applications within the aerodrome safeguarded area.
6.11.3 Developments within the airport’s 13km aerodrome safeguarded 
zone which could impact on the safe operation of aircraft will need 
to be assessed. Safeguarding covers a range of issues for example, 
developments which could increase the risk of bird strikes, such as open 
water, landscaping and buildings that attract hazardous bird species 
and provide areas of roosting. The use of lighting could be distracting 
to pilots due to luminance or the arrangement which could be mistaken 
for airfield lighting. The use of highly reflective building materials 
could cause glint/glare for pilots or have radar absorbing or reflective 
characteristics. Tall structures could cause a collision hazard or interfere 
with navigation equipment or result in building induced turbulence. 
Beyond the 13km safeguarding zone, wind farms can also impact on 
radar and navigation equipment and will need to be assessed. Any 
mitigation strategy will also need to consider any cumulative impact.

People and Place6.11.4 Public Safety Zones (PSZ) 
8 are defined by the Civil Aviation Authority 
(CAA) reflecting risk of aviation-related accidents. They are areas of land 
at the end of a runway within which certain planning restrictions apply. 
They aim to control the number of people on the ground at risk in the 
unlikely event of an aircraft accident on take-off or landing. Newcastle 
International Airport has one runway with aircraft taking off and landing 
in both directions. The current PSZs at each end of the runway are shown 
on the Policies Map. Within the PSZs there should not be an increase 
in the number of people, residing, working or congregating within it. 
Guidance on the approach to development in PSZs is set out in the 
Department for Transport Circular.
6.12 Flood Risk and Water Management
6.12.1 Newcastle is vulnerable to a range of flooding from sources including 
tidal along the Tyne, fluvial along the Ouseburn and surface water, sewer 
and groundwater flooding in parts of the city.
6.12.2 CSUCP Policy CS17 identifies the council’s strategic approach to 
managing flood risk by directing development towards sites and areas 
with the lowest risk using the Sequential Test and, where applicable, the 
Exception Test. Policy DM26 seeks to ensure developments are designed 
to minimise and mitigate the risk of flooding, ensuring surface water is 
effectively managed on-site and to prevent any increase in flood risk 
elsewhere.
Policy DM26 - Flood Risk and Water Management
1. Development will be required to manage and reduce flood risk by:
 i. avoiding the culverting of watercourses, building over culverts,  
 and where possible, remove existing culverts;
 ii. maximising permeable surfaces and incorporate green   
 infrastructure, to reduce surface water run-off within Critical  
 Drainage Areas;
 iii. contributing to reducing or delaying run-off within river   
 catchments through river restoration, creation of upstream storage  
 areas, and tree planting, where appropriate; and
 iv. minimising development on existing green space where it has the  
 potential to manage flood risk at catchment scale.
2. Development will be required to demonstrate that its surface water 
drainage strategy, site layout and design will:
 i. prevent properties from flooding from surface water, including an  
 allowance for climate change and urban creep;
 ii. not increase the risk of flooding elsewhere and that exceedance 
 flows will be managed;
Policy DM26
65


=== PAGE 66 ===

  
iii. ensure run-off from development is constrained to greenfield  
 rates, or as close to greenfield rates as possible; for brownfield  
 sites, up to a minimum 50% reduction;
 iv. manage surface water as close to source as possible using source  
 control measures;
 v. follow the SuDS management train approach, to manage water  
 quantity and quality throughout the site;
 vi. provide the most sustainable SuDS techniques from the SuDS  
 Hierarchy;
 vii. where feasible and appropriate, integrate SuDS into public open  
 space and connect to adjacent watercourses or wetlands; and
 viii. demonstrate the life-time maintenance and management of the  
 SuDS.
3. Development must ensure it takes the opportunity to protect and 
improve surface and ground water quality and quantity and enhances 
the river environment by:
 i. implementing appropriate water pollution control measures;
 ii. including measures to treat surface water run-off pollution within  
 the design of the drainage system;
 iii. safeguarding and providing river buffers with appropriate habitat;
 iv. naturalising watercourse channels and creation of wetland habitat;
 v. improving biodiversity and ecological connectivity of   
 watercourses and its banks; and
 vi. mitigating agricultural and urban diffuse pollution, including  
 impacts from the transport network.
6.12.3 Flood Risk Assessments (FRA) and drainage strategies will be required to 
support applications demonstrating how flood risk and water quality will 
be managed over the lifetime of the development taking into account 
climate change. The FRA will need to assess flood risk from rivers, 
ordinary watercourses, surface water, groundwater, mine water and 
artificial sources, or where development could affect flood management 
assets, such as culverts and Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS). The 
assessment of proposals will be proportionate to the size and location 
of the development. A FRA and drainage strategy must demonstrate that 
the development is protected from flooding, does not increase flood 
risk elsewhere, and contributes to reducing flood risk where possible. 
Developers will be required to incorporate flood resilient design and 
construction. Detailed information is provided in the Flood Risk and 
Surface Water Management Guidance Note.

Policy DM26

People and Place6.12.4 All development has the potential to increase surface water flooding. 
Within Critical Drainage Areas (CDAs) set out in the Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment, an increase in the rate and volume of surface water run-
off from new development through an increase in impermeable areas, 
additional hard standing, extensions or infill development, has the 
potential to exacerbate the degree of existing flood risk. Within CDAs, 
development including minor and householder proposals will need 
to address surface water runoff, by incorporating green infrastructure. 
Opportunities should also be taken to reduce or delay run-off from 
river catchments using natural flood management measures, such as 
river restoration, landscape management and upstream water storage. 
Development should be minimised around existing green space, 
woodlands, natural wetlands, ponds, and other permeable surfaces 
which provide flood management benefits or have the potential to 
provide flood risk management at a catchment scale.
6.12.5 Development should avoid culverting waterways and where possible 
remove obsolete structures or encumbrances and “daylight” culverted, 
piped or covered watercourses. Where the opportunities arise, old 
culverts should be replaced with alternatives. Alongside the banks of 
a watercourse an undeveloped strip (buffer zone) should be provided 
to ensure protection and enhancement of the river corridor, providing 
habitat for wildlife and space for flood management.
6.12.6 Managing surface water run-off from development is vital in reducing 
flood risk. All developments are expected to use SuDS, these should be 
considered at an early design stage to ensure appropriate type, sufficient 
space and suitable location are achieved. A drainage strategy for the 
development will need to demonstrate how SuDS can be implemented 
in line with current national guidance and the council’s local standards 
and guidance. The drainage strategy should include details on how 
SuDS will be used to reduce surface water run-off rates and manage 
volumes, and how the conveyance and storage of surface water will 
be accommodated within the site layout. The design of SuDS should 
adopt the management train approach. ‘Soft SuDS’ such as ponds and 
swales are preferred as they mimic natural drainage while providing 
environmental benefits. The satisfactory performance of SuDS depends 
not only on good design but also adequate maintenance. The lifetime 
maintenance and management of a SuDS will therefore be secured 
through a maintenance and management plan. Where a development is 
required to provide SuDS on site, developers will be required to maintain 
the SuDS in perpetuity. Detailed information is provided in the Flood 
Risk and Surface Water Management Guidance Note.

6.12.7 The Water Framework Directive9 (WFD) and the Northumberland River 
Basin Management Plan10 (NRBMP) seek to protect and enhance the 
quality of the city’s waterbodies. Development adjacent to, or likely 
to affect the quantity and quality of groundwater or surface water 
bodies, must seek to improve water quality, improve and enhance 
ecology, fisheries and mitigate against any heavily modified waterbody 
designation. Surface water run-off in urban areas, including the highway 
network contains a mix of polluting substances. Drainage that discharges 
into any watercourse, must incorporate pollution control measures 
such as SuDS and green infrastructure to allow interception of surface 
water contaminants reducing the potential for diffuse pollution and 
sedimentation improving water quality and benefiting ecology. Water 
quality assessments may be required for development which will result 
in a physical modification to a watercourse or could indirectly adversely 
affect surface water or groundwater. The assessment should consider the 
likely impacts on water quality and mitigation required to avoid harm.
6.12.8 Development within the River Tyne and Ouseburn catchments should 
seek to improve river water quality and the capacity for surface water to 
support wildlife. The Ouseburn will significantly benefit from restorative 
measures. Actions and opportunities outlined in the NRBMP and any 
other relevant river restoration plans in and adjacent to Newcastle must 
be considered. Where possible development close to a watercourse 
should contribute towards restoration and naturalisation opportunities 
aiming to restore the natural state and functionality of the watercourse 
in support of biodiversity enhancements, ecology benefits, improved 
flood management, landscape development and recreational purposes.
6.12.9 The impact of urbanisation including highway networks can leave 
rivers designated as ‘Heavily Modified’ under the WFD. In order for any 
waterbody (Ouseburn, Seaton Burn, Newburn and the Tyne estuary) 
in the Newcastle area to reach their ‘Good’ classification, highways 
and their drainage need to be addressed at all outfalls. Highways and 
drainage should be designed to address the polluting effect of the 
highway run-off. Highway drainage which goes through swales or SuDS 
would also benefit water quality and ecology.

6.13 Protecting and Enhancing Green 
Infrastructure
6.13.1 National planning guidance sets out the importance of protecting and 
enhancing green infrastructure. Green infrastructure provides multi-
functional benefits, such as adaptation to climate change, improved 
resilience to extreme weather events, enhanced biodiversity and 
ecosystem services, improved visual amenity and landscape quality, 
sustainable travel opportunities and improved public health and well-
being.
6.13.2 The principle of protecting and enhancing the city’s Strategic Green 
Infrastructure Network and the requirement to plan positively for the 
creation, enhancement and management of networks of biodiversity and 
green infrastructure is set out in CSUCP Policy CS18 and UC15.
6.13.3 Green infrastructure links between areas provide physical and visual 
connection via features such as river corridors, tree-lined routes, public 
rights of way and cycle routes that enable the migration and movement 
of species and encourage residents to be more active improving health 
and wellbeing. The protection, provision of new, or improvements to 
existing green infrastructure, including ensuring connectivity between 
the different elements, is an important part of delivering and maintaining 
high quality, sustainable communities as set out in Policy DM27.
Policy DM27 - Protecting and Enhancing Green Infrastructure
Development will be required to optimise the benefits and to enhance existing 
green infrastructure assets, and contribute towards the delivery of new green 
infrastructure assets by:
1. Providing on-site green infrastructure, or where it can be demonstrated 
that this is not possible, contribute to off-site provision.
2. Addressing gaps in the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network corridors, 
providing improvements within the Opportunity Areas designated on the 
Policies Map, and enhancing the function of the Green Belt as a green 
infrastructure resource.
3. Requiring proposals for the creation of new green infrastructure assets 
or enhancements of existing green infrastructure assets to:
 i. maximise multifunctionality;
 ii. enhance connectivity and accessibility;
 iii. enhance biodiversity;
 iv. contribute to the area’s character and improve visual amenity;
 v. take opportunities to include community involvement and   
 education;
Policy DM27
69


=== PAGE 70 ===

 vi. secure long-term maintenance and management; and
 vii. incorporate climate change mitigation measures.
4.  Any development that would have an adverse impact on green 
infrastructure assets will be required to demonstrate that the benefits of 
any development will outweigh the harm.
6.13.4 There are various ways in which green infrastructure can be incorporated 
into proposals, for example, through the incorporation of open space 
and recreational areas, planting of new trees and landscaping, green 
walls, green roofs and SuDs. New green infrastructure assets should be 
designed and located to maximise its range of functions and benefits 
including protecting and enhancing biodiversity.
6.13.5 Green infrastructure should be included on walking and cycling routes, 
wagon ways, public rights of way and promote access to river corridors 
and green streets helping both connectivity for people and wildlife. 
Using the green infrastructure network for cycling, walking, horse riding 
and access for non-motorised users offers multifunctional benefits such 
as allowing access to natural space, wildlife and improving the health of 
local communities.
6.13.6 New and enhanced green infrastructure should be designed to positively 
contribute to the area taking account of the Landscape Character 
Assessments. Proposals will be required to consider the wider green 
infrastructure context of the surrounding landscape. Visual screening 
opportunities should be considered for new infrastructure and industrial 
development.
6.13.7 Green infrastructure offers the opportunity to reduce flood risk through 
managing run-off and providing flood storage. In built-up areas it can 
reduce the effect of urban heat islands, providing urban cooling, access 
to shady informal outdoor space, and helping absorb carbon dioxide.
6.13.8 Green infrastructure space promotes community involvement and 
education through developing opportunities for community food 
growing and community uses providing for improvements to health and 
wellbeing.
6.13.9 The Strategic Green Infrastructure Network is made up of six main 
corridors which link important green spaces. Within these areas priority 
will be given to addressing gaps in the network that limit wildlife 
movement or access by people. The following corridors are designated 
on the Policies Map:
 1. Seaton Burn and Prestwick Carr;
 2. Gosforth Park and Weetslade;
 3. Ouseburn to Walbottle Dene;
 4. Wallsend Burn to Haddricks Mill;
 5. Town Moor and Woolsington;
 6. Tyne Corridor.

areas have been identified. These are areas where there are 
opportunities to create and enhance green infrastructure. They include 
areas at Brenkley Colliery, Upper Ouseburn Valley, Denton Dene, 
Newburn Haugh/Riverside, Newcastle City Centre, Jesmond Dene/ Lower 
Ouseburn Valley, Scotswood, Walker Riverside, Walker Park and along 
the River Tyne. Further detail on green infrastructure opportunities areas, 
including projects and priorities for improvement will be identified in a 
Green Infrastructure Delivery Framework. This will set out in more detail 
what improvements will be priortised.
6.13.11 The council has approved masterplans for a number of sites that seek 
to deliver the land allocations in the CSUCP . These plans have taken 
account of CS18 in the CSUCP and demonstrate how the housing 
allocations can be delivered incorporating strategic green infrastructure 
to deliver sustainable communities. It is expected that sites will be built 
out in accordance with the approved masterplans.

6.14 Trees and Landscaping
6.14.1 Trees, woodland and landscaping are a vital component of ecosystems. 
They deliver a wide range of environmental, economic, social, health 
and climatic benefits. Trees and landscaping contribute to the landscape 
character of areas, enhancing visual amenity and the appearance of 
development, they provide habitats and allow connectivity for wildlife, 
offer shade and shelter to mitigate the urban heat island effect and 
address urban cooling. They also assist in reducing surface water runoff 
mitigating flood risk and can mitigate air pollution contributing to 
improving health and wellbeing.
6.14.2 CSUCP Policy CS18 identifies the need to protect, enhance trees and 
manage woodland as part of the city’s green infrastructure assets. 
Policy DM28 requires development to protect trees and landscape 
features, provide compensation for any loss and provide new trees 
and landscaping which achieve multifunctional benefits. Reference to 
trees in this policy includes single trees, tree groups, woodlands and 
hedgerows.
71


=== PAGE 72 ===

Policy DM28 - Trees and Landscaping
1. Development will be required to protect, enhance and manage existing  
 trees and landscape features.
2. Development which would unacceptably harm or result in the loss 
of trees or landscape features, will not be permitted unless it can be 
demonstrated that:
 i. development cannot be reasonably located elsewhere within the  
  development site;
 ii. the need for and benefits of development clearly outweighs 
any harm to ecological value, landscape quality and historical 
significance of the area and in the case of ancient woodland and 
veteran trees there are wholly exceptional reasons; and
 iii. appropriate mitigation and/or enhancement measures are   
  provided.
3. Development will be required to include new trees and landscape  
 features where appropriate, which:
 i. enhance the quality and character of the development and   
  surrounding area;
 ii. provide connectivity and enhancements where possible to the  
Strategic Green Infrastructure Network Corridors and Wildlife 
Enhancement Corridors;
 iii. assist in providing multifunctional environmental benefits; and
 iv. assist in reducing or mitigating run-off and flood risk.
6.14.3 Development will need to consider existing trees and landscape features 
both on and adjacent to the site. Where trees and other important 
landscape features may be affected by development a tree impact 
survey will be required. Landscape features which contribute to the 
character of an area should be incorporated into the design and layout 
of development. Where it can be demonstrated that this is not feasible 
or practicable and there is an over-riding benefit that outweighs the 
loss of these features, then appropriate landscape mitigation and 
enhancement of the site will be required. Development should ensure 
that sufficient space is provided to enable trees to reach their optimum 
size and landscape features to mature and for development to take place 
without adversely affecting trees or established landscape features. 
Trees and important landscape features that are to be retained will need 
to be adequately protected to avoid damage during construction.
6.14.4 Development will be required to include new trees and landscaping 
which will enhance the quality and character of the area. Where a 
development site is on or adjacent to a Wildlife Enhancement Corridor 
or a Green Infrastructure Network Corridor the design and placement of 
trees should enhance and strengthen the connectivity to the corridor. 
Within areas at risk of surface water flooding, for example the Urban 
Core or as part of sustainable drainage schemes, new planting, including 
green walls and roofs can help alleviate the risk.

People and Place Trees and landscaping should also be used to mitigate and enhance sites 
affected by local environmental conditions including air quality, urban 
heat islands and wind tunnel effects. Further guidance will be set out in 
the council’s Tree Strategy and an SPD.
6.14.5 Many trees in the city are protected by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) 
and the council where required will make additional TPOs to ensure that 
existing trees, or groups of trees, which are healthy and contribute to the 
amenity of the area, are retained and protected. The council will also use 
its powers under the Hedgerow Regulations 1997 to protect hedgerows 
of historic or nature conservation importance.

6.15 Protecting and Enhancing Geodiversity, 
Biodiversity and Habitats
6.15.1 National guidance sets out the need to plan positively for the 
creation, protection and enhancement of biodiversity in accordance 
with the hierarchy of international, national and locally designated 
sites. Development should have regard to the biodiversity and 
geodiversity of the city both by protecting and where possible providing 
enhancements. CSUCP Policy CS18 seeks to protect and enhance the 
natural environment. DM29 supports this by ensuring the diversity and 
richness of the city’s flora and fauna is protected and enhanced helping 
to provide a rich and varied landscape and ecological environment 
throughout the city. This policy applies to all development affecting the 
nature conservation not just designated sites and Wildlife Enhancement 
Corridors.
Policy DM29 - Protecting and Enhancing Geodiversity, Biodiversity and Habitats
1. Development which may affect any designated site, biodiversity or 
important habitat or species, or geological feature must be supported by 
an up to date ecological assessment to ensure the likely impact of the 
proposal can be assessed and mitigated.
2. Development which has a direct or indirect adverse effect on a Site of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) should not normally be permitted.
3. Development which directly or indirectly causes significant harm to a 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR), Local Wildlife Site (LWS), Local Geological 
Site (LGS), and/or Site of Local Conservation Interest (SLCI), as designated 
on the Policies Map, and/or protected species should be avoided. Where 
significant harm cannot be avoided, development will be refused unless:

  compensatory measures are secured.
4. Development which would have an adverse effect on priority habitats  
 and priority species will not be permitted unless adequate mitigation  
 can be provided.
5. Development which would have an adverse effect on the biodiversity  
 value or connectivity and function of the Wildlife Enhancement Corridor  
 as designated on the Policies Map, will only be permitted where   
 adequate mitigation is secured.
6. Development will be required to protect and enhance habitats and  
 provide net gains in biodiversity by:
 i. retaining natural features and habitats and protecting them during  
  construction;
 ii. maintaining and improving buffers and ecological connectivity to  
  the wider environment;
 iii. creating and restoring habitat to provide corridors and stepping  
  stones for wildlife; and
 iv. securing future management arrangements.

People and Place6.15.2 Biodiversity must be considered as an integral part of the site selection, 
design and development process. Biodiversity standards will be 
included in an SPD. In addition to safeguarding the conservation value 
of designated and other important ecological sites, proposals should 
seek opportunities to enhance biodiversity wherever possible, for 
example, through appropriate landscaping and retention of significant 
vegetation. Development should incorporate appropriate new habitats 
as part of landscaping or buildings, particularly in areas of deficiency. 
Provision of new habitats should focus on priority habitats, as identified 
in the Newcastle and North Tyneside Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP)11 
and consider the adaptability of species to the likely impacts of climate 
change. Examples of enhancement include: habitat restoration, re-
creation and expansion and improved links between existing sites. 
Where appropriate the design of proposals should promote public 
access, study, interpretation and appreciation of biodiversity.
6.15.3 The maintenance, enhancement and restoration of sites of national 
and local importance for biodiversity and geology will be promoted 
and supported. There are currently no internationally designated 
sites (Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), Special Protection Areas 
(SPA)) within the Newcastle boundary, however the River Tyne allows 
connectivity to international and national coastal and marine designated 
sites, which include the Northumbria SPA and Ramsar site and Durham 
Coast SPA. The city has five Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 
and six Local Nature Reserves (LNR) which are statutory designated 
sites. SSSI are of national importance for their flora, fauna or features 
of geological interest. Local Nature Reserves (LNR) are of local, but not 
necessarily national importance. They include places with wildlife or 
geological features that are of special interest locally in terms of wildlife, 
geology, education and public enjoyment. Within regard to development 
which is likely to have an adverse impact on a SSSI, the only exception is 
where the benefits of the development in the location proposed clearly 
outweigh both its likely impact on the features of the sites that make it 
of special interest, and any broader impacts on the national network of 
SSSI.
6.15.4 Non-statutory sites rely on the planning system for protection and 
include Local Wildlife Sites (LWS) (previously known as Sites of Nature 
Conservation Importance (SCNI)), Sites of Local Conservation Interest 
(SLCI), and Local Geological Sites (LGS). LWS are of regional or local 
significance for wildlife and LGS are important for their geological/
geomorphological features. SLCI form a third tier of valuable wildlife 
sites and allow for protection and enhancement of sites which lack 
outstanding habitats or features, but have undoubted value to a 
particular settlement or neighbourhood. Selection is based on an 
ecological assessment and analysis of species, habitats and, connectivity, 
including increased weight given to the interest of a site to the local 
community. Appendix 4 lists all protected sites and both statutory and 
locally designated sites are shown on the Policies Map.

=== PAGE 76 ===

Protected Species and Priority Habitats and Species
6.15.5 Protected species and priority habitats and species are protected under 
national legislation. Locally identified priority habitats and species 
are set out in the BAP . An ecological survey will be required to assess 
the presence of protected species and priority habitats and species in 
accordance with current national standards and published guidance.
6.15.6 Development should aim to avoid adversely affecting national and local 
designated nature conservation sites, protected species and priority 
habitats and species, by using alternative sites or layout designs. Where 
avoidance is not possible and the need for and benefit derived from 
development outweighs the nature conservation value of the site, 
habitat or species, the impact upon the wildlife sites, habitat or species 
must be adequately mitigated.
6.15.7 Valuable species of flora and fauna are also found outside of designated 
national and local sites and should be considered as part of the planning 
process as they are important for migration, dispersal and genetic 
exchange.
 
Wildlife Enhancement Corridors
6.15.8 The Wildlife Enhancement Corridors overlap with, but are distinct from, 
the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network. The Wildlife Enhancement 
Corridors provide an inter-connecting ecological network of habitats 
which allow the movement of species between urban and rural areas 
helping to maintain species, habitat richness and variety. However, the 
Strategic Green Infrastructure Network has a multifunctional purpose. 
In the urban area, most Wildlife Enhancement Corridors follow chains 
of public and private open space, the River Tyne and major road, rail 
and Metro corridors. In rural areas the corridors are defined in some 
cases by linear features, notably watercourses, and in others by a 
linking of recognised wildlife sites and features such as woodlands and 
hedgerows.
6.15.9 Wildlife Enhancement Corridors do not preclude development coming 
forward. They provide an indication of where development proposals 
are required to assess the role and route of the Wildlife Enhancement 
Corridor on or adjacent to the development site and take account of 
any habitats and features, including stepping stones, which contribute 
to the function of the corridor. In respect of approved masterplans, site 
specific approaches to Wildlife Enhancement Corridors demonstrate 
how the objectives of the policy will be achieved. It is expected that 
developments will follow the approaches set out in the masterplans. 
6.15.10 Biodiversity and habitat enhancements to provide net gains and 
mitigation for any habitats and species or features of value that are 
harmed or lost should be provided on-site. Where this is not possible, 
planning obligations will be required to secure off-site enhancements 
and mitigation to allow for habitats, species and features replacement, 
and may include enhancing existing Wildlife Enhancement Corridors.

Sports and Recreational Buildings and Land
6.16.1 The Newcastle Open Space Assessment (2018) identifies existing 
quantitative supply and access to open space by ward, and provides an 
assessment of the current and future requirements for open space across 
the city, based on a comprehensive local needs assessment which sets 
standards for open space provision, and identifies existing and future 
needs. The standards for open space comprise a qualitative, quantitative 
and accessibility element, all of which are afforded equal weighting in 
the assessment. All open space should be afforded protection unless it 
can be proved it is not required in line with Policy DM30.
6.16.2 The Newcastle Plan for Playing Pitches (2015) sets out the current use 
of playing pitch facilities, the demands and pressures placed on areas 
of the city, team generation rates from future development, and the 
ambitions and priorities of the key sports governing bodies. The Plan 
for Built Facilities in Newcastle (2015) identifies future requirements for 
sports hall and swimming pool provision across the city, notes priorities 
and any gaps in provision, and sets out potential future mechanisms.
6.16.3 Provision of sufficient open space, sports and recreational buildings 
and land of appropriate quality and accessibility plays an important role 
in the sustainability of communities. Provision of open space, sports 
and recreational buildings and land as set out in Policy DM30 will be 
required as part of new development and where there are existing 
deficiencies in quantity or access to open space and/or where the new 
development would result in deficiencies. The standards are informed by 
the council’s Open Space Assessment and represent a level of provision 
that is considered to meet the needs of residents, whilst providing a 
standard which it is reasonable to expect new developments to deliver.
Policy DM30 – Protecting and Providing for Open Space, Sports and Recreational 
Buildings and Land
1. Development of open space, sports and recreational buildings and 
land, including playing fields, as shown on the Policies Map, will not be 
permitted unless an assessment has been undertaken in accordance with 
the council’s open space standards for existing provision as set out in 
Table 1 and information used from the council’s Open Space Assessment, 
Plan for Playing Pitches and Plan for Built Facilities demonstrating:
 i. there is a proven surplus of such provision and the proposed loss  
 will not result in a current or likely shortfall in the plan period; or
 ii. any loss resulting from development will be replaced by the  
 equivalent or better provision in terms of both quality and   
 quantity in a suitable location; or
 iii. the development proposed is for alternative sports and recreation  
 provision the benefits of which clearly outweigh the loss of the  
 current or former use.
Policy DM30

=== PAGE 78 ===

2. Development which would result in the loss of open space not shown 
on the Policies Map that contributes to the character and visual amenity 
of an area will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that the 
benefits of development clearly outweigh the loss.
3. Development of ancillary facilities on open space will be supported 
where:
 i. it is necessary to or would facilitate the functioning of the open  
 space;
 ii. it would be appropriate in scale and it would not detract from the  
 character of the site or surroundings;
 iii. it would not have an unacceptable negative impact upon   
 residential amenity;
 iv. it would not be detrimental to any other function that the open  
 space performs; and
 v. it would contribute positively to the setting and quality of the  
 open space.
4. Residential development will be subject to the thresholds for open 
space provision set out in Table 2 and will be required to contribute 
to the provision of new open space, sports and recreational buildings 
and land, enhancements to existing open space and maintenance to 
meet the council’s open space standards for new development, as set 
out in Table 3, and the council’s priorities, as set out in the Open Space 
Assessment, Plan for Playing Pitches and Plan for Built Facilities. 
5. Open space, sports and recreational buildings created as part of a 
development will be required to:
 i. be of an appropriate size and quality;
 ii. be accessible to the public;
 iii. be designed to be safe, useable and integrated into the   
 development;
 iv. maximise its multifunctional benefits;
 v. take opportunities to improve the connectivity and accessibility of  
 the Strategic Green Infrastructure Network; and
 vi. include a suitable long-term management and maintenance  
 programme.
6. Communal food growing opportunities within major residential 
developments will be encouraged.

People and Place6.16.4 Open Spaces above 0.15 hectares are shown on the Policies Map. Parcels 
of open space under 0.15 hectares not included on the map which are 
deemed of value will also be afforded a degree of protection by criterion 
2 of Policy DM30. To avoid a proliferation of small amenity green spaces 
which have limited recreational function, the minimum size of amenity/
natural green space considered acceptable as part of new development 
and count towards open space provision will need to be 0.15 hectares 
in size (about the size of a mini football pitch). Any spaces below this 
size may be acceptable in terms of their visual amenity and/or where 
required for the provision of sustainable drainage. However, these 
smaller areas will not count towards the required level of provision.
6.16.5 In addition to the minimum size threshold of 0.15 hectares, all amenity 
green space should be of an appropriate landscape design and quality 
to provide recreational and biodiversity value by adopting the following 
principles:
• capable of supporting informal recreation such as a kick about, space  
  for dog walking or space to sit and relax;
• include high quality planting of trees and/or shrubs to create   
  landscape structure and biodiversity value;
• include paths along main desire lines, lit where appropriate;
• be designed to ensure easy maintenance.
6.16.6 Open space provision varies across the city wards, with some areas 
having identified deficiencies and others having sufficient provision. 
The existing quantity and access to open space, as well as consideration 
of quality issues, will form the basis for assessing any proposed 
development or change of use of open space. Open space typologies are 
defined in the glossary.

6.16.8 The council recognises that in certain circumstances, existing open 
spaces may not be required to meet current or future need for open 
space. In these circumstances, alternative use of the open space will 
be considered. Factors to be taken into account before any decision to 
release open space for alternative uses can be taken, include:
• The local recreational value and use of a given open space by   
  residents;
• Its visual quality and the contribution it makes to visual amenity in  
  the neighbourhood in which it is located;
• Whether future local development/population growth might   
  generate additional demands for open space;
• Whether there is a demonstrable need for another type of open  
  space within the locality that a given space (subject to a change of  
  management regime) would be well placed to meet; and
• Other non-recreational reasons that suggest a space should   
be retained. Its ecological value, in terms of biodiversity and the 
contribution the site makes or could make to the Strategic Green 
Infrastructure Network or Wildlife Enhancement Corridors.
6.16.9 Developers wishing to bring forward alternative uses for open space 
must provide an assessment which clearly demonstrates that the policy 
criteria have been met using information provided within the council’s 
Open Space Assessment, Plan for Playing Pitches and Plan for Built 
Facilities. This assessment should be provided as part of any planning 
application.
6.16.10 The reconfiguration of land identified as open space can be an effective 
approach to addressing identified deficiencies. The change of use 
of one typology into another can help secure its future as part of re-
provision and may provide windfall opportunities. For this reason, 
consideration will be given to proposals that provide demonstrable 
improvements in the functional value, accessibility to and public use 
of open space through its reconfiguration. Proposals will need to form 
part of a deliverable, comprehensive development scheme where 
open space requirements have been positively considered. Where 
development of open space is proposed where the standards are not 
met or would be infringed, the loss must be offset by the creation of, or 
financial contributions towards, an alternative open space site of at least 
equal size, accessibility and quality located within the same residential 
neighbourhood as the development site, where possible, or where this is 
not possible, the same ward as the development site.

People and Place6.16.11 While open space sites are categorised into different typologies, the 
multifunctionality of different types of open space is important to 
recognise, for example, amenity green space, natural green space, 
parks and recreation grounds can also provide habitat for wildlife 
conservation, flood alleviation, improving air quality and providing 
food growing opportunities. Communal food growing areas in new 
developments extends beyond the provision of gardens and allotments 
and includes the creative use of roofs, walls and balconies. It might 
also include areas of landscaping. New or improved open space shall 
incorporate areas of biodiversity habitat complementing surrounding 
habitats and supporting the BAP . Species chosen for planting across 
the space must maximise the biodiversity benefit. Public open space 
must also provide local land drainage benefits and may include SuDS. 
The provision of new open space provides the opportunity to positively 
contribute to Newcastle’s Strategic Green Infrastructure Network and 
Wildlife Enhancement Corridors by providing links to and extensions of 
the networks.
6.16.12 Small-scale ancillary facilities on open space can positively contribute 
to the value of green and open spaces, enhancing the potential for 
public use and enjoyment of those spaces. For example, refreshment 
facilities, car parking, changing rooms or flood lighting, particularly 
where they support social and community infrastructure, can meet local 
needs and positively enhance the recreational value of any adjacent 
open space. However, the insensitive design and siting of such facilities 
can detract from the character of open space, adversely impact on the 
environmental functions it performs and place limitations on the range 
of uses possible on open space. Any proposals for ancillary facilities 
must therefore be appropriate to their location, and not compromise the 
value and the function that open space can perform.
6.16.13 Playing fields are one of the most important resources for sport. 
They provide the valuable space required to maintain and enhance 
opportunities for people to participate both in formal team sports and 
in other more informal activities. Along with sporting benefits, good 
quality, accessible playing fields also contribute to maintaining active 
and healthy communities. The council has a statutory duty to protect all 
playing fields identified for the use of sport, including football, cricket 
and rugby. The Parks and Recreation Ground standard should form the 
starting point for discussions regarding how pitch provision is met. 
The councils Plan for Playing Pitches and Plan for Built Facilities will 
also be used to help the assessment of planning applications which 
affect playing fields and built facilities and inform applicants of their 
requirements to provide or fund playing pitches or new facilities. The 
council has carried out a comprehensive review of all sports facilities 
across the city and is working with sports governing bodies to identify 
and target future needs and investment in appropriate locations.
6.16.14 Any proposals for new sports facilities are encouraged to promote 
multiple use to meet the needs of the local community. Facilities 
on privately owned land can play an important role in the provision 
of sports and recreation space and access to these facilities will be 
encouraged. There may also be opportunities for the dual-use of 
open spaces and sports facilities such as the use of school and higher 
education facilities for the benefit of the local community.
81


=== PAGE 82 ===

6.16.15 For the purposes of this policy, loss of open space which is used 
primarily for sport or recreation is taken to include the loss of any 
recreational buildings ancillary to and directly associated with the open 
space and essential to its recreational function.
6.16.16 New development will be required to provide open space, and sports 
and recreational buildings either on-site, or where appropriate, 
contribute to improve existing facilities off-site. Table 2 provides the 
thresholds for the requirement for on-site and off-site provision and 
will be used as guidance for decision-making. The requirements for 
new provision will be assessed on the type and size of development 
and on the existing quantity and access to open space and sports and 
recreational buildings within the local area. Where on-site provision is 
required, this will be provided in line with the quantity standards for new 
provision as set out in Table 3. 
6.16.17 Where off-site provision is required, a financial contribution will be 
sought to improve existing local facilities in line with the council’s 
priorities set out within the Open Space Assessment, Plan for Playing 
Pitches, Plan for Built Facilities, Planning Obligations SPD and Green 
Infrastructure Delivery Framework. The majority of types of housing will 
be considered eligible for making contributions towards open space to 
meet the needs of future occupants. Exceptions to this are set out in 
the Planning Obligations SPD. Where an off-site contribution for open 
space is required, contributions towards the provision or improvement of 
open space will be calculated using the guidance set out in the Planning 
Obligations SPD.

6.16.18 The decision on whether the provision is to be on-site or off-site or both 
depends on the following considerations:
• the scale of the proposed development, site area and site constraints;
• the suitability of a site reflecting, for example, its topography or flood  
  risk;
• the existing provision of open space within the neighbourhood and/ 
  or ward;
• other sites in the neighbourhood where additional provision is proposed;
• existing access to open space within the neighbourhood and/or ward. 
6.16.19 For new development, the standards will indicate overall requirements; the 
precise type, form and location being determined by local circumstances 
and evidence and guided where appropriate, by a masterplan or brief. 
Table 3 sets out the quantity and accessibility standards: 
6.16.20 The Open Space Assessment sets out quality standards for the different 
typologies of open space. Developers providing open space on-site 
will be required to consult these standards and ensure that any on-site 
facilities are provided in line with this guidance. Developers will be 
required to submit design proposals for on-site open space as part of the 
planning application. A management plan for open space will also need 
to be submitted and approved as part of a planning obligation.
6.16.21 If a development is required to provide open space on-site, developers 
will be required to maintain the new provision in perpetuity. Accordingly, 
a suitable programme of maintenance is required to accompany 
provision of new areas of open space for a period of five years to allow 
establishment of landscaping. The long-term management will be 
secured through a management company.

6.16.22 While residential development results in increased pressure upon 
existing open space, it also offers the opportunity to provide new 
open space or secure enhancements to existing facilities that can 
benefit future occupiers and the wider community. A higher quality 
and wider variety of open space is often more valuable to communities 
than a greater quantity of provision. An intelligent approach will be 
needed to ensure that development delivers open space provision or 
enhancements that address identified needs. For example, in areas with 
good access to these parks and recreation grounds or amenity green 
space, it may be more effective to make qualitative improvements to 
existing parks which support increased use, or focus on increasing the 
provision of other typologies for which there is a substantial shortfall 
in the area. Policy DM30 requires that open space is accessible to the 
public and is of a sufficiently high quality. The functionality of existing 
open space will also be improved where possible, allowing a greater 
range of open space to be available to residents.

6.17 Green Belt Development
6.17.1 The Tyne and Wear Green Belt forms a wide band of protected land 
around the northern and western edge of Newcastle. Its boundary is 
shown on the Policies Map. National guidance sets out the forms of 
development that are appropriate in the Green Belt. Policy DM31 sets 
out where development may be considered appropriate within the 
Woolsington Village Envelope in the Green Belt and for the re-use of 
existing buildings within the Green Belt.
Policy DM31 - Green Belt Development
1. Within the Woolsington Village Envelope Green Belt, as defined on the 
Policies Map, limited extensions to buildings, infill development and 
replacement of buildings will only be allowed where it meets national 
policy requirements for the Green Belt; and
 i. it retains the verdant, spacious character and amenity of the  
 village; 
 ii. it retains and takes opportunities to enhance tree and landscape  
 features on the site.
2. Within the Green Belt the re-use of buildings will only be allowed where:
 v. the existing historic features of the building are retained and any  
 repairs respect its significance and historic character.
People and Place
Policy DM31

People and Place  
i. the positive character of buildings and their setting is retained;
 ii. the buildings are in a good structural condition and capable of  
 conversion without substantial re-building;
 iii. there are no disproportionate extensions over and above the size  
 of the original building; 
 iv. there are no ancillary new buildings; and 
 v. the existing historic features of the building are retained and any  
 repairs respect its significance and historic character.
6.17.2 Woolsington is the only village in the city within the Tyne and Wear 
Green Belt boundary. Due to the nature of the village there is the very 
limited potential to accommodate small amounts of development within 
its defined village settlement boundary. This would usually be in the 
form of extensions to existing properties which would maintain the 
verdant and open character of the village.
6.17.3 The Green Belt in Newcastle includes a number of buildings. This policy 
sets out criteria against which proposals for the re-use of buildings in 
the Green Belt will be assessed. The criteria protect the character of the 
buildings, their setting and the openness of surrounding Green Belt. All 
of the criteria will need to be met to demonstrate that the re-use of the 
building is acceptable. Permitted development rights will normally be 
removed for development in the Green Belt to prevent the proliferation 
of buildings that would harm its character and openness.

 Resources need to be managed in a sustainable manner. Minerals are 
a finite resource and waste must be minimised. The policies set out 
criteria and requirements to ensure that any proposals do not have any 
unacceptable adverse impacts on the natural and built environment and 
health.
7.1 Minerals Extraction and Reclamation
7.1.1 Minerals can only be worked where they are found. This factor, together with 
the potential environmental impacts of extraction, limits where minerals 
extraction is feasible. National planning guidance advises it is important to 
provide for the extraction of mineral resources, to safeguard resources so that 
suitable sites are not lost unnecessarily to other development and to plan for a 
steady and adequate supply of aggregates and industrial minerals. Newcastle 
cooperates with other mineral planning authorities in the north east of 
England to plan for a steady and adequate supply of minerals. Newcastle is 
an active member of the North East Working Party and works with four other 
Tyne and Wear authorities, Durham County Council, Northumberland County 
Council and Northumberland National Park Authority to prepare an annual, 
joint Local Aggregates Assessment to assess options and forecast future 
demand for aggregates in this area. The sub-regional requirement for Tyne 
and Wear is to contribute approximately 3.7 million tonnes for sand and gravel 
and 5.8 million tonnes of crushed rock for the period to 2017-2032. The level 
of permitted reserves at existing mineral sites in Tyne and Wear are sufficient 
to supply the sub-regional apportionment to a date beyond 2030 for both 
sand and gravel and crushed rock. In terms of industrial minerals, a 27-year 
stock of permitted reserves of brick clay is available to support investment in 
Throckley Brickworks from Red Barns Quarry in South Tyneside.
7.1.2 The whole of the Newcastle area is identified as a Mineral Safeguarding 
Area (MSA) in CSUCP Policy CS20, based on shallow coal reserves found 
throughout the area. There are also small pockets of sand and gravel 
deposits and potential for winning fireclay or brick clays in conjunction 
with coal extraction sites. There is however, no presumption that 
extraction of resources within the MSA will be extracted at any time. 
Any proposals for minerals extraction would need to comply with Policy 
DM32 and CSUCP Policy CS20 together with relevant policies in the 
CSUCP , the DAP and national planning guidance.

Policy DM32 - Minerals Extraction and Reclamation
1. Development of minerals operations will only be supported where it can 
be demonstrated that all material social, economic and environmental 
impacts that would cause demonstrable harm to the natural and historic 
environment or human health can be acceptably mitigated. Proposals 
will need to demonstrate no unacceptable adverse impact on:
 i. the natural, geological and built environment, including features  
 of archaeological, historic or architectural importance;
 ii. landscape character;
 iii. nationally or locally designated wildlife sites, protected species  
 and their habitats and ecological networks;
 iv. nationally protected landscapes;
 v. best and most versatile agricultural land;
 vi. human health and local amenity, including from noise, vibration,  
 dust, lighting and visual intrusion;
 vii. road safety, traffic and local congestion;
 viii. air quality;
 ix. aviation safety;
 x. mining subsidence and land stability;
 xi. soil resources;
 xii. flood risk;
 xiii. the flow, quality and quantity of surface and groundwater and  
 drainage;
 xiv. risk of contamination from the site; 
 xv. the cumulative effects of multiple impacts from individual sites  
 and/or a number of sites in a locality; and
 xvi. climate change.
2. Proposals for minerals extraction must include a detailed restoration, 
aftercare and after-use strategy and a programme of works that provides 
high quality aftercare and restoration which enhances its landscape, 
ecological and recreational value.
3. Minerals infrastructure sites for bulk transport, handling and processing 
of minerals, recycled and secondary aggregate facilities, and the 
manufacture of concrete and concrete products and coating facilities, 
including those identified on the Policies Map, will be safeguarded from 
unnecessary loss to non-mineral related development. Proposals for 
non-mineral development within a minerals infrastructure site will not 
be supported, unless it can be demonstrated that:
Minerals and Waste
87
Policy DM32


=== PAGE 88 ===

 i. The proposal will not prejudice the current or future use of the  
 site;
 ii. The site is no longer needed for mineral handling, processing,  
 storage and transport; or
 iii. Alternative minerals related infrastructure and/or capacity can be  
 provided at an alternative site. 
7.1.3 Minerals extraction, including open cast mining, by its very nature has a 
disruptive effect on land taken for working, on the landscape character 
of an area and on the amenities of surrounding communities. It can 
cause visual intrusion, noise, vibration, dust, light pollution and heavy 
traffic, resulting in an adverse impact on the quality of life for those 
living near to the sites. The working of minerals sites can also have 
significant adverse environmental impacts, including land stability and 
drainage problems, increased flood risk, loss or harm to local wildlife 
and their habitats and can result in hazardous conditions for aviation 
safety. It therefore needs to be demonstrated, as part of any planning 
application, that the impacts of minerals extraction can be mitigated to 
acceptable levels, which will be determined on an individual site basis.
7.1.4 The cumulative effects of multiple impacts from individual sites, or a 
number of sites in a locality, will be an important consideration in the 
assessment of planning applications for minerals extraction. The un-
coordinated and piecemeal working of sites which result in prolonged 
effects on the landscape and surrounding local communities will not be 
permitted.
7.1.5 Restoration and aftercare schemes should take advantage of 
opportunities to enhance the quality of land and landscapes following 
extraction of minerals and secure appropriate long-term after uses 
that fit with their context and bring benefits for the local and/or 
wider community. Enhancements include the creation of biodiversity 
and geodiversity interests, linking of site restoration to other green 
infrastructure initiatives, high quality landscape character, improved 
public access, employment, tourism and provision of climate change 
mitigation measures. A minimum of 15 years long-term management of 
restored sites following extraction of minerals will be required. Where 
appropriate, restoration bonds will be sought as a safeguard to ensure 
that minerals sites are restored to a high standard.
7.1.6 National planning policy sets out the need for local minerals authorities 
to safeguard existing, planned and potential sites for a range of minerals 
infrastructure. Within Newcastle there are no identified existing or 
identified future sites for bulk transport, handling and processing of 
minerals. Six sites set out in table 4 below and identified on the Policies 
Map are identified as being used for the manufacture of concrete and 
concrete products and recycled and secondary aggregates materials 
within the city. Policy DM32 (3) safeguards both these existing sites 
and future mineral infrastructure sites as long as they are operationally 
required for the supply and manufacture of minerals.

7.2 Area of Search
7.2.1 National planning policy requires mineral planning authorities to plan 
for a steady and adequate supply of minerals by identifying specific 
sites, a preferred area, Areas of Search and location criteria for minerals 
extraction. For this reason, land at Dewley Hill, north of Throckley, is 
designated as an Area of Search for the extraction of coal and any 
secondary minerals.
Policy DM33 - Area of Search
Dewley Hill site is designated on the Policies Map as an Area of Search for the 
extraction of coal and other secondary minerals. The acceptability of working this 
search area will be assessed in line with National and Local Plan Policy.
7.2.2 Dewley Hill site covers 110 hectares and is currently agricultural land 
within the Green Belt (Figure 7). The potential operator estimates that 
approximately 800,000 tonnes of coal and 200,000 tonnes of fireclay 
could be extracted from the site. Land to the east of the site is allocated 
for housing development (CSUCP Policy CS3)  and therefore extraction 
of minerals from this site would need to take into consideration the 
impact on any nearby future housing development coming forward. 
The acceptability of any minerals extraction from this area would also 
need to be assessed against the relevant policies of the CSUCP and DAP 
to demonstrate that it would not result in any unacceptable adverse 
impacts. 
7.2.3 A tributary of Dewley Burn runs through the proposed Dewley Hill 
mineral extraction site. Any mineral extraction that could potentially 
have an adverse environmental impact on the waterbody would need to 
be mitigated.

7.3 Recycling and Refuse Storage Provision
7.3.1 The council is currently preparing a waste strategy which promotes an 
innovative approach to waste management and provision. CSUCP Policy 
CS21 sets out the council’s strategic approach to the management of 
waste. Policy DM34 outlines site specific refuse storage and recycling 
provision requirements.
Policy DM34 - Recycling and Refuse Storage Provision
The location and appearance of refuse storage and recycling provision will be 
required to be an integral part of the development and demonstrate high-quality 
design of waste facilities. Refuse storage and recycling provision will be required 
to provide:
 i. the necessary capacity needed by the development and which  
 can be adequately accessed so that waste can be serviced by  
 refuse collection vehicles;
 ii. for non-residential developments, shared housing and major  
 flatted development, shared recycling facilities and refuse bins of  
 sufficient capacity to serve the proposed development;
 iii. for other residential development, space for the storage of 
individual recycling and refuse bins to reflect the current 
collection regime and communal recycling facilities and refuse 
bins of the required capacity to serve the proposed development 
as a whole; and
 iv. for residential properties with private gardens provision for the  
 separate storage of garden waste for collection or composting.
7.3.2 Recycling and refuse storage provision is a necessary requirement for 
all new development. Poorly sited or designed waste storage facilities 
can have adverse impacts on the amenity of an area by way of visual 
impacts, odours and obstruction of the highway. Lack of suitable 
road access can adversely impact on the provision of refuse servicing 
arrangements for residents.

7.3.3 The council is seeking to improve sustainability of waste management 
and will encourage developers to consider high quality design solutions. 
Whole street solutions and underground communal waste facilities 
should be explored. These have multiple benefits including improved 
design of development allowing more space for open space and/or 
parking, collection vehicles will not need to access every property and 
reduced frequency of collection.
7.3.4 This policy requires all new development to include recycling and refuse 
provision of adequate quantity and quality, in the interests of ensuring 
that the visual appearance, amenity and safety of areas is maintained.
 
7.3.5 The council has approved guidance setting out the recycling and refuse 
storage requirements for new development. Refuse management 
strategies should accompany planning applications for new 
development to explain the rationale for the proposed location and 
design of the facilities to be provided and collection arrangements.

 Assessments of available infrastructure and the cumulative impact 
of development are critical to sustainable development. The city has 
experienced increasing pressure on schools, services and on transport 
infrastructure in recent years and thus development growth should 
contribute to meeting infrastructure need, taking into account viability. 
The CSUCP Infrastructure Delivery Plan sets out schemes which will 
support development.
 The adopted Community Infrastructure Levy will help fund strategic, 
largely off-site infrastructure and schemes will often need to contribute 
to site mitigations or pooling of developer contributions in accordance 
with the CSUCP Policy DEL 1.
8.1 Telecommunications and Digital 
Infrastructure
8.1.1 The development of telecommunications and digital infrastructure 
is recognised as an important driver for both the local and national 
economies together with the promotion of the digital industry and clusters.
8.1.2 CSUCP Policies CS5, CS9 and CS11 set out the role of enhanced 
services and infrastructure in providing more sustainable communities 
and creating more employment opportunities by providing attractive, 
cutting-edge infrastructure. Policy DM35 sets out criteria to be used for 
telecommunications and digital infrastructure development.
Policy DM35 - Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure
1. Development for new or upgraded telecommunications infrastructure 
will be required to demonstrate that:
 i. the installation(s) will be kept to a minimum, consistent with the  
 efficient operation of the network;
 ii. the site is the most sustainable option with all alternatives   
explored (including opportunities for the sharing or clustering of  
facilities and siting masts on existing buildings);
 iii. there will be no significant impact on visual and residential amenity, 
and the character of any building, structure or wider area; and
 iv. there will be no significant and irremediable interference with  
 electrical equipment, air traffic services or instrumentation in the  
 national interest.
2. Major development will be required to demonstrate how it supplies 
digital infrastructure to access electronic communications networks 
within the site boundary.

8.1.3 National planning guidance outlines that telecommunications 
applications must be supported by detailed information including 
consultations with interested organisations and a certification that the 
operational exposure for new masts or base stations (or additions to 
existing) will not exceed International Commission on non-ionising 
radiation protection guidelines.
 
8.1.4 In order to conserve the visual and residential amenity and the character 
of any building, structure or locality operators should be encouraged to 
develop innovative solutions to address any impacts. The council has a 
preference for the clustering or sharing of facilities rather than erecting 
new sites/equipment unless a clear need can be demonstrated.
8.1.5 Digital technology will help deliver social and economic growth and 
plays a vital role in the provision of local community facilities and 
services. The council will expect development to be supported by 
the latest digital infrastructure and encourages early discussions with 
operators.

Appendix 2 - Road Hierarchy
Newcastle’s road hierarchy includes strategic roads (which are managed by 
Highways England), Primary Distributor Roads and Secondary Distributor Roads. 
Each road category and the development and traffic characteristics are set out in 
the table below.
Strategic Road
Primary 
Distributor Road
Secondary 
Distributor Road
Nationally significant roads used for the distribution of goods and 
services, and a network for the travelling public.
• These are the preferred roads for motorised vehicles and generally 
connect to Strategic Roads.
• The ability of these roads to operate efficiently helps to support 
local economies, and provide attractive routes which can divert 
motorised vehicles from more sensitive areas. They will often 
carry large volumes of traffic which generally have a local origin 
or destination within the principal residential, commercial and 
industrial areas.
• The servicing and loading requirements for developments will be 
considered on a case by case basis.
• New developments fronting these roads must provide off-street 
parking solutions, which should only be accessed from the side or 
rear of the development.
• Pedestrian and cycle movements should be segregated from traffic 
and controlled by formalised crossing points.
• These roads generally connect Strategic and Primary Distributor 
Roads to smaller areas and carry significantly lower volumes of 
traffic with fewer HGV’s than either of the above categories.
• The servicing and loading requirements for developments will be 
considered on a case by case basis. 
• Local traffic will predominate and pedestrian and cycle movement 
should be controlled by formalised crossing points.
• Pedestrian and cycle movements should be segregated from traffic.
• Frontage access may need to be restricted and there will be parking 
on many of these roads; on-street parking should be discouraged, 
but when this is not achievable then distinct parking lay-bys/areas 
should be provided.

Distributor Road
Public Transport Distributor Roads can be classed as either Primary 
or Secondary Distributor Roads. They are based on existing key bus 
corridors into the Urban Core and experience some of the highest bus 
flows in Newcastle. They service residential, retail and public services 
within Newcastle and surrounding authorities. Defining Public Transport 
Distributor Roads reflects the emphasis on bus priority along these 
routes.

These Flood Zones refer to the probability 
of sea and river flooding only, ignoring the 
presence of existing defences.
• Flood Zone 1 is the land outside the flood 
plain, i.e. areas not shown as within flood 
zone 2 or 3 on the flood zone maps. There 
is little or no flood risk in this zone.
• In Flood Zone 2 there is a low to medium 
risk of flooding.
• In Flood Zone 3a there is a high probability 
of flooding.
An area of land around built-up areas where 
there is a presumption against inappropriate 
development. The fundamental aim of a Green 
Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by 
keeping land permanently open; the essential 
characteristics of Green Belts are their 
openness and their permanence.
Green infrastructure includes, but is not 
limited to, wildlife sites, parks and gardens, 
areas of countryside, woodland and street 
trees, allotments and agricultural land, outdoor 
sports provision, local green spaces, footpaths, 
cycle and bridleways, areas of historic values, 
floodplains, ponds, lakes and watercourses.
A network of high quality green and blue 
spaces and other environmental features.
Land (or a defined site) usually farmland, that 
has not previously been developed.
A street or right of way that, through a variety 
of design and operational treatments, gives 
priority to pedestrian circulation and open 
space over other transportation uses. The 
treatments may include pavement widening, 
landscaping, traffic calming, and other 
pedestrian-orientated features. A green street 
can also manage surface water run-off as a 
resource, with landscaping planters or swales 
to capture run-off and filter pollutants. 
Habitable rooms are defined as living, dining, 
kitchen, bedroom, study, games room, 
nurseries etc. Non-habitable rooms are defined 
as bathrooms, toilet, hall, landing, cloakroom, 
utility room, elevations with no windows.

A concept underpinning the development 
of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), that 
tries to mimic the natural environment and 
provides flood risk and water quality benefits. 
Management of surface water involves using 
various SuDS components at source (i.e. where 
heavy rainfall occurs); along the pathway (i.e. 
the means or routes by which stormwater is 
conveyed through a site or catchment); to the 
receptor (i.e. where stormwater flows collect).
Documents which add further detail to the 
policies in the Local Plan. They can be used to
provide further guidance for development on 
specific sites, or on particular issues, such as 
design. Supplementary Planning Documents 
are capable of being a material consideration 
in planning decisions but are not part of the 
development plan.
The sustainability appraisal considers the 
social, environmental and economic effects 
of a plan from the outset, to help ensure 
that decisions are made that contribute to 
achieving sustainable development.

Development supporting the 
telecommunications and digital networks, for 
example, radio towers and fibre optic cables. 
A comprehensive and systematic process that 
sets out transport issues relating to a proposed 
development. It identifies what measures 
will be required to improve accessibility and 
safety for all modes of travel, particularly for 
alternatives to the car such as walking, cycling 
and public transport and what measures will 
need to be taken to deal with the anticipated 
transport impacts of the development.
A simplified version of a transport assessment 
where it is agreed the transport issues arising 
out of development proposals are limited and 
a full transport assessment is not required.

Appendix 6 - Car and Cycle Parking Levels
This appendix sets out guidance on the levels of car parking required to meet the 
operational needs of residential and non-residential developments.1
Car and cycle parking levels cited in Appendix 6a, 6b and 6c are 
recommendations and site-specific considerations and improvements to 
accessibility should be taken into account with all planning applications. 
Proposed parking levels should be justified and set out in a Transportation 
Statement or Transport Assessment as appropriate.  Factors that will be 
considered when determining the appropriate level of car parking include the 
location of the site, the nature of the development, how sustainable it is, the 
availability of public transport, the impact on residential amenity and highway 
safety.
Residential Car Parking Levels
The residential parking levels shown in Appendix 6a relate to Use Class C3 and 
apply citywide. The recommended parking level is based on the number of 
habitable rooms plus the number of allocated car parking spaces.
In many new developments allocating parking spaces for each house/ flat may 
not be the most efficient use of development land and unallocated parking could 
be provided with residents and visitors sharing communal parking spaces. This 
can work particularly well where car ownership is lower, the area is served by 
good public transport and a controlled parking zone is in place in the surrounding 
area. 
Car parking levels for student accommodation will depend on site-specific 
considerations such as its location and the presence of parking restrictions in the 
surrounding area.  The provision of adequate pick up and drop off facilities is a 
key consideration.   
Parking levels for residential development, including student accommodation 
should be justified and set out in a Transportation Statement or Transport 
Assessment as appropriate.  Proposals should demonstrate how the parking 
needs of disabled people have been considered. 
Non-Residential Parking Levels
For non-residential parking levels, the authority has been divided into two areas: 
the City Centre and Urban Areas as shown in appendix 6d.  Appendix 6e shows a 
detail of the City Centre Area. 
Appendix 6b details the car parking levels within the City Centre and the Urban 
Area.  Where no parking level is given in Appendix 6b, parking will be examined 
on the proposed development’s own merits. 
Parking levels for non-residential development should be justified and set out in 
a Transportation Statement or Transport Assessment as appropriate.  Proposals 
should demonstrate how the parking needs of disabled people have been 
considered.

and Parking developer guidance 2015.

=== PAGE 114 ===

Cycle Parking Levels
The recommended cycle parking levels shown in Appendix 6c apply citywide. 
Where a proposed development comprises a number of separate premises 
(for example, a parade of shops), they may be aggregated for the purposes of 
guideline calculation.
The levels are calculated to incorporate both operational needs for staff and non- 
operational needs for visitors (and as appropriate, for residents).
Proposed parking levels should be justified and set out in a Transportation 
Statement or Transport Assessment as appropriate.  
Appendix 6a
Residential (C3) car parking levels (citywide)
For example, a development of 5 houses each with 4 habitable rooms (2 
bedrooms, kitchen and living room) can have the following car parking scenarios;
No allocated spaces (all spaces communally available)
5 x 1.3 = 6.5
7 communal spaces are required.
Each property has a drive, but no garage (1 allocated space per property)
5 x 1.5 = 7.5
8 spaces are required, 3 of which are communal.
Each property has a drive and useable garage (2 allocated spaces per property)
5 x 2.4 = 12
12 spaces are required, 2 of which are communal.

Appendix 8 - Employment Marketing Guidance
Policy DM2 seeks to prevent the loss of allocated employment sites for B1, 
B2 and B8 uses. It provides the criteria against which a change of use to an 
alternative use would be assessed. This Appendix sets out what an applicant 
needs to be provide in order for the Local Planning Authority to make an 
assessment of a change of use application. Early engagement with the council is 
also recommended.
To address the criteria in the Policy DM2 Protection of Employment Sites, the 
following should be submitted and demonstrated:
i. How has the property or site been marketed?
This should include:
• Contact information should be posted on the property/site in the form of an 
advertising board, in a prominent place where it is clearly visible from the 
street
• The property/site should be registered with at least one property agent who 
normally deals in commercial property (a Commercial Property Agent rather 
than Residential Estate Agent).
• Property details (particulars) should be produced outlining type of property/
site, address, size, location, description, services, planning/current use, terms, 
leasehold rent or freehold sale price, viewing arrangements. These details 
should be available to enquirers on request and be submitted as supporting 
information with planning applications.
• Planning applications should be submitted with a summary of marketing 
responses. This should include:
-  Number/type of enquiries received
-  Number of viewings
-  Number, type/proposed uses and value of offers
-  Reasons for refusal of an offer
• Has the property or site been marketed for alternative employment use or 
redevelopment, in terms of use and size of units? 
• The marketing of properties should consider current relevant permitted 
development rights for changes of use between B Use Classes.
• A feasibility study and financial appraisal is needed to demonstrate that 
redevelopment of the premises/site for employment use is not viable.
Appendix 8 - Employment Marketing Guidance


=== PAGE 129 ===

129
ii. What price has it been offered at?
This should be commensurate with the current market price for similar commercial 
premises/sites, bearing in mind the following:
• The type of premises in question (B1, B2, B8, etc), the standard of 
accommodation (age, state of repair, facilities on offer, etc)
• The location
• Where premises are marketed for lease, the length of the lease should not 
be unduly restrictive. Details of the lease terms should be included in the 
marketing report.
• Where inquiries have been limited the marketing report should explain how 
proactive measures have been undertaken to refresh the campaign.
iii. How long has it been marketed for?
• The site should be marketed continuously and actively for a period of 2 years.
• Where a building is in poor condition marketing should be for redevelopment 
for B Class Use where possible.
For applications that would lead to the loss of allocated employment property/
site, it would need to be clearly demonstrated that there is no demand for an 
employment use on the property/site in question. Active marketing together 
with appropriate advertisement is needed to fully demonstrate that there is no 
reasonable prospect of the property/site coming forward for its protected use.

Appendix 9 - Monitoring Framework
Introduction 
Monitoring is a fundamental element of delivering an effective plan-led system 
and the objectives set out in Newcastle’s Local Plan. As part of this, a framework 
must be in place to measure and determine the effectiveness of the Local Plan 
and when necessary set out actions and interventions required to ensure the 
policies in the Local Plan are appropriate. 
The Core Strategy and Urban Core Plan (CSUCP) contains a monitoring framework 
which was prepared jointly with Newcastle City Council and Gateshead Council 
to monitor the policies of the CSUCP , the Strategic Objectives and Sustainability 
Objectives (established within the Sustainability Appraisal). The CSUCP 
monitoring framework contains 52 indicators to monitor the extent to which the 
Local Plan policies are being achieved.
The CSUCP indicators provide an effective basis for assessing a broad range of 
issues and it is considered that many of the issues raised within DAP policies 
can be appropriately monitored using indicators already established within the 
CSUCP . Additional indicators, however, have been developed to monitor some 
DAP policies where necessary. These additional indicators have been set out in 
the DAP Monitoring Framework, which comprises Table 1 and 2. 
• Table 1 sets out the trigger points and the potential remedial actions that will 
be taken into account when reviewing policies in the Local Plan. 
• Table 2 sets out indicators which monitor specific DAP policies which are not 
capable of being monitored through the CSUCP monitoring framework. 
The DAP indicators will be used alongside the indicators already established 
in the CSUCP monitoring framework. The indicators reflect the need to balance 
achieving effective monitoring of policy with appropriate sources of data and 
use of resources. Over time the indicators may need to be revised to respond 
to changes in the availability of information and in response to any new 
requirements over the plan period.
The Approach to Monitoring
Continuing monitoring is essential to ensure the policies of Newcastle’s Local 
Plan are effective. The DAP Monitoring Framework and its indicators have been 
prepared to align with the CSUCP monitoring framework, which similarly includes 
a table comprising trigger points and remedial actions as well as a table setting 
out the monitoring targets.
There are a range of indicators set out in both the CSUCP and DAP monitoring 
frameworks, comprising indicators which are quantitative, or statistical in nature, 
outlining key data which relates to the policy, particularly those which propose, 
or aim to manage, additional development. However, not all policies can be 
monitored in numeric terms and there are indicators which are qualitative in 
nature, where a contextual or narrative update is necessary to measure the 
impact of the policy, and others are monitored through the granting or refusal of 
planning permission indicating how the policy is performing. Monitoring can also 
be based on other criteria including measuring of the Housing Delivery Test, five-

Some indicators are suitable for frequent monitoring, for instance, where 
data is published annually, while others are reported on less frequently due 
to the nature of the data and the methods of collection. It is important that 
evidence reports are regularly updated, a process integrated with the wider 
implementation and monitoring of the Local Plan. The evidence includes the 
Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (HELAA) and Employment 
Land Review (ELR), which provide the context to underpin the policies relating to 
housing and employment land allocations.  
Each year, as part of the monitoring process, the council prepares an Authority 
Monitoring Report (AMR). The AMR provides an update on the monitoring 
indicators and reports on the progress and implementation of the policies in 
Newcastle’s Local Plan. The AMR and relevant evidence base reports provides an 
appropriate and flexible approach to monitoring over the plan period.
Effectiveness of Local Plan Monitoring 
Monitoring Indicators can provide evidence to determine whether policies 
are effective. Policies can divert from their intended objectives in the course 
of monitoring over a period of time, these unintended consequences are the 
‘triggers’ .
Each monitoring indicator in the CSUCP and DAP include examples of the 
‘triggers’ which may require action to address failings in implementation of 
delivery and, where applicable, examples of potential actions which could be 
used to try and rectify these issues. 
The council will monitor triggers over a period of time and take into account 
overall how well the Local Plan’s policies and strategic objectives are being met 
and achieved using a range of the monitoring indicators, this will generally be 
undertaken on a five-year cycle to coincide with the review of the Plan itself.
The need to review specific policies, consider alternative strategies or take other 
appropriate action will be based on several factors, including taking account 
of information on the likely future delivery, e.g. information from the planning 
customer feedback report, discussions with developers on the implementation of 
schemes as well as discussions with internal officers. For policies which allocate 
or designate sites, the review of Local Plan policies required by National Policy, 
provides an appropriate opportunity to provide an update on any relevant 
development proposals. 
Although not an exhaustive list, the council through using some of these 
measures will determine the significance of the triggers and the extent to which 
if any are not performing as initially envisaged or intended or the delivery of 
policies is limited, the council will use the monitoring framework to consider the 
most appropriate measures and actions required to be taken.
To support the implementation and monitoring process, a report will be prepared 
for the council’s Cabinet annually; this will provide an update on the performance 
of the Local Plan policies and proposals, when compared against the targets. 
The indicators outlined in the CSUCP and DAP Monitoring Frameworks, together 
are considered to be an effective strategy for monitoring the implementation of 
the Local Plan, objectives, policies and allocations.
